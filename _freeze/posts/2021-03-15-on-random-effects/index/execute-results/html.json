when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is random.\n\n---@green1960\n\nIn our example study, the observed levels of emotional arousal (non-aroused vs aroused) exhausts the \"population\" of emotional arousal states, while the set of speakers is just a sample from the whole population of speakers.\n\n### (4) Random events\n\n> If an effect is assumed to be a realized value of a random variable, it is called a random effect.\n\n---@lamotte1983\n\nA random variable is a variable generated by a random event.\n\nIn the f0 study, the speakers that participated in the study are the outcome of random events, while we assume that the relation between f0 and arousal is governed by a specific mathematical relationship.\n\n### (5) Shrinkage\n\nThe last definition of fixed vs random effects is based on the method employed to estimate them.\nFixed effects are estimated using maximum likelihood, while random effects are estimated with partial pooling.\nPartial pooling means that the estimation of the random effects influence the estimation of the fixed effects and vice versa.\nThis definition is standard in the multilevel modelling literature [@snijders2011, Section 4.2] and in econometrics.\n\nA consequence of partial pooling is the so-called \"shrinkage\".\nShrinkage refers to the \"regression to the mean\", by which the estimated effects are attracted towards the overall mean (i.e. the intercept).\n\nSo in the f0 study, the by-speaker random intercepts \"shrink\" towards the estimated fixed intercept.\nIn sum, fixed effects are effects without shrinkage while random effects are effects with shrinkage.\n\nThus, under this definition, whether one chooses to model an effect with or without shrinkage has to do with the underlying process model one expects to have generated the observed data.\nIf the expected process of a variable entails shrinkage, then it would make sense to enter such variable as a random effect.\n\n## Some final thoughts\n\nI agree with Gelman's statement that the terms \"fixed\" and \"random\" could (and perhaps should) be avoided altogether.\n\nWithin the Bayesian framework, for example, it is becoming common to use the terms \"**population-level**\" and \"**group-level**\" effects to indicate, respectively, effects that are generated by a population-wide process vs effects that are generated by the modulation of such generative process within groups that make up the population.\n\nAs in definition (5) above, group-level effects are estimated with partial pooling [for a nice detailed explanation of partial pooling that includes robots cuing for coffee and tadpoles, see @mcelreath2015, Ch 12].\n\nTo conclude, whether you include a variable as a fixed or random effect will depend on (a) which definition of random effect you (explicitly or implicitly) choose, and (b) what underlying generative process you envision to be at play.\n\n### Reference\n",
