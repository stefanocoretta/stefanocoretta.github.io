We just plug in the numbers to get $n_e$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_o <- 150\nse_o <- 10\nse_e <- 5\n\nn_e <- ( ( sqrt(n_o) * se_o ) / se_e )^2\nn_e\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 600\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe sample size required to go from an $se_o$ of 10 Hz to an $se_e$ of 4 Hz is 600. 😱\n\nSo to get an $se$ that is half of the observed one we would need 4 times the number of data points.\n\n\n\n# Functions ex machina\n\nLet's spice our coding up a bit and write a few functions we can use to calculate samples sizes for different &se_e$s.\n\nAlso, so far we've been talking about $se_e$ or, in other words, the standard deviation of the of the posterior probability of the effect of interest.\nIf you remember your probability 101, you should know that the width of the 95% CrI of a posterior probability is 4 times the standard deviation.\n\nSo let's write a function to calculate $n_e$ based on the *width* of the 95% CrI, rather than on the $se_e$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nestimate_n <- function(obs_se, obs_n, width, divide = 1) {\n  sigma <- sqrt(obs_n) * obs_se\n  se <- width / 4\n  new_n <- (sigma / se)^2\n  return(new_n / divide)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's take it for a spin, using the numbers from the example above.\nThe $se_o$ we observed was 10 Hz, that's corresponds to a width of $10 * 4 = 40$ Hz.\n(Note that the first argument is the $se_o$, not the width, but you can change that for consistency if you wish).\nThe sample size $n_o$ was 150.\nThe $se_e$ we want was 5 Hz, so the width is $5 * 4 = 20$ Hz.\n\nLet's plug in these numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nestimate_n(obs_se = 10, obs_n = 150, width = 20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 600\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we have already seen above, to get a 95% CrI width of 20 Hz, we would need at least 600 observations.\n\n\nNow let's define a few functions that calculate the required sample size at different widths and create a plot.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_obs_range <- function(obs_se, obs_n, min_width = 1, max_width, by = 1, divide = 1) {\n  obs_range <- NULL\n  for (i in seq(min_width, max_width, by = by)) {\n    obs_range <- c(obs_range, estimate_n(obs_se, obs_n, i, divide))\n  }\n  return(obs_range)\n}\n\nplot_obs_range <- function(obs_se, obs_n, min_width = 1, max_width, by = 1, divide = 1) {\n  obs_range <- get_obs_range(obs_se, obs_n, min_width, max_width, by, divide)\n\n  ggplot2::ggplot() +\n    aes(x = seq(min_width, max_width, by = by), y = obs_range) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_path() +\n    labs(\n      caption = paste0(\"SE = \", obs_se, \", \", obs_n, \" obs\"),\n      x = \"CI width\",\n      y = paste0(\"Estimated N \", \"(N/\", divide, \")\")\n    )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's now plot the required sample sizes to reach a 95% CrI width in the range from 10 to 50, by 5.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_obs_range(10, 150, min_width = 10, max_width = 50, by = 5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 3000, 250))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/rr, eval-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
