Welcome to the homepage of Stefano Coretta ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): [ˈsteˑfano koˈrɛtta]).

I am currently a postdoc researcher at the [Institute of Phonetics und Speech Processing](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/) at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München (Germany).
I obtained my PhD degree in linguistics at the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020.
My area of research is *linguistics* with a focus in *phonetics and phonology*---the study of speech sounds and their relation to [*linguisticality*](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03056) (Human Language).

Some of the questions my research tries to answer are:

- *How do we produce the sounds we use in our daily communication?*
- *How do these sounds create a system?*
- *What are the attested sound systems of the languages of the world, and why are they the way they are?*
- *What can we learn about human cognition from the knowledge of how sound systems work?*
