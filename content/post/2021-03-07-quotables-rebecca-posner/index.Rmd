> How many Romance languages are there?
>
> An answer to this question that has been slightingly labelled *sancta simplicitas* is that there is only one: the languages are all alike enough to be deeemed dialects of the same language. Another equally disingenous answer might be 'thousands'---of distinctive local varieries---or 'millions'---of individual idiolects. The usual textbook answer is 'ten, or possibly eleven', according priority to putative chronologically early differentiation from the common stock, allegedly linked to ethnic differences among speakers.
