This is my researcher's positionality statement (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.34293/) for context).

It is a work in progress, in two senses:

- In one sense, it is not exhaustive and I will be adding statements as they occur to me.
- In the other sense, it is an ever-changing document, since I do and will change my mind about any of the statements.

# The statements

In random-ish order, divided by category (for now, epistemological and ontological).

For each statement, prepend "In my opinion".
In some cases *opinion* refers to my expert opinion, in others to my intuitions (for the helpfulness of intuition in science, see the work by physicist [Fritjof Capra](https://www.fritjofcapra.net)).
In time, I will add references to the statements, when relevant.

## Epistemological

1. There is no agreement as to what [science]{.smallcaps} actually is.
1. Science is not the only way to gain knowledge.
1. There is no agreement as to what [language]{.smallcaps}, [human language]{.smallcaps}, [linguistic capacity]{.smallcaps}, [linguisticality]{.smallcaps} actually are.
1. There is no agreement as to whether [language]{.smallcaps}, [human language]{.smallcaps}, [linguistic capacity]{.smallcaps}, [linguisticality]{.smallcaps} are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities.
1. There is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are [innate]{.smallcaps} and wich are [learned]{.smallcaps}.
1. There is no agreement as to what [innate]{.smallcaps} actually means.
1. There is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely [domain-specific]{.smallcaps}/[domain-general]{.smallcaps}, or if it is a bit of both.
    1. If it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are [domain-specific]{.smallcaps} and which are [domain-general]{.smallcaps}.
1. There is no agreement as to what a [language]{.smallcaps} is. In fact, in English *language* is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written *Language* and *language* respectively).

## Ontological

1. Science has both [objective]{.smallcaps} and [subjective]{.smallcaps} components.
1. Statistics and statistical inference have both [objective]{.smallcaps} and [subjective]{.smallcaps} components.
1. [linguisticality]{.smallcaps} is the human ability to communicate through a language, and a [language]{.smallcaps} is a specific communicative system used by a specific group of humans.
1. If one defines [linguisticality]{.smallcaps} as the human ability to communicate through a language, then saying that only humans have linguisticality is a tautology.
1. All living beings are capable of communicating.
