<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>This is my researcher’s <span class="smallcaps">positionality statement</span> <span class="citation">(for context, see <a href="#ref-darwin2020" role="doc-biblioref">Darwin Holmes 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-jafar2018" role="doc-biblioref">Jafar 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <span class="smallcaps">positionality</span> both describes an individual’s <span class="smallcaps">world view</span> and the <span class="smallcaps">position</span> they adopt about a research task and its social and political context. The individual’s world view or ‘where the researcher is coming from’ concerns <span class="smallcaps">ontological assumptions</span> (an individual’s beliefs about the nature of social reality and what is knowable about the world), <span class="smallcaps">epistemological assumptions</span> (an individual’s beliefs about the nature of knowledge) and assumptions about <span class="smallcaps">human nature and agency</span> (individual’s assumptions about the way we interact with our environment and relate to it).</p>
<p>It is important for new researchers to note here that their positionality not only shapes their work but influences their interpretation, understanding, and, ultimately, their belief in the truthfulness and validity of other’s research that they read or are exposed to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <span class="citation">Darwin Holmes (<a href="#ref-darwin2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, p. 1-3.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, in two senses:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one sense, it is not exhaustive and I will be adding content as it occurs to me.</li>
<li>In the other sense, it is an ever-changing document, since I will frequently change my mind about any part(s) of content herein.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections provide a thought-out description of my ontological and epistemological belief systems.
The reader should interpret all of the statements made here as “my personal opinion”.
In some cases <em>opinion</em> refers to my <span class="smallcaps">expert opinion</span>, in others to my <span class="smallcap">intuitions</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
With time, I will add references where/if relevant.</p>

<li>There is no agreement as to whether <span class="smallcaps">language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">human language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguistic capacity</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguisticality</span> are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are <span class="smallcaps">innate</span> and which are <span class="smallcaps">learned</span>.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to what <span class="smallcaps">innate</span> actually means.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely <span class="smallcaps">domain-specific</span> or entirely <span class="smallcaps">domain-general</span>, or if it is a bit of both.

<li>If it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are <span class="smallcaps">domain-specific</span> and which are <span class="smallcaps">domain-general</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>There is no agreement as to what a <span class="smallcaps">language</span> is. In fact, in English <em>language</em> is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written <em>Language</em> and <em>language</em> respectively).</li>
