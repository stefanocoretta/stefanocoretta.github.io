<p>This is my researcher’s positionality statement (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.34293/">this paper</a> for context).</p>
<p>It is a work in progress, in two senses:</p>
<ul>
<li>In one sense, it is not exhaustive and I will be adding statements as they occur to me.</li>
<li>In the other sense, it is an ever-changing document, since I do and will change my mind about any of the statements.</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-statements" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The statements</h1>
<p>In random-ish order, divided by category (for now, epistemological and ontological).</p>
<p>For each statement, prepend “In my opinion”.
In some cases <em>opinion</em> refers to my expert opinion, in others to my intuitions (for the helpfulness of intuition in science, see the work by physicist <a href="https://www.fritjofcapra.net">Fritjof Capra</a>).
In time, I will add references to the statements, when relevant.</p>
<div id="epistemological" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Epistemological</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is no agreement as to what <span class="smallcaps">science</span> actually is.</li>
<li>Science is not the only way to gain knowledge.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to what <span class="smallcaps">language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">human language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguistic capacity</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguisticality</span> actually are.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to whether <span class="smallcaps">language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">human language</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguistic capacity</span>, <span class="smallcaps">linguisticality</span> are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are <span class="smallcaps">innate</span> and wich are <span class="smallcaps">learned</span>.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to what <span class="smallcaps">innate</span> actually means.</li>
<li>There is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely <span class="smallcaps">domain-specific</span>/<span class="smallcaps">domain-general</span>, or if it is a bit of both.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are <span class="smallcaps">domain-specific</span> and which are <span class="smallcaps">domain-general</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>There is no agreement as to what a <span class="smallcaps">language</span> is. In fact, in English <em>language</em> is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written <em>Language</em> and <em>language</em> respectively).</li>
</ol>

<div id="ontological" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Ontological</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Science has both <span class="smallcaps">objective</span> and <span class="smallcaps">subjective</span> components.</li>
<li>Statistics and statistical inference have both <span class="smallcaps">objective</span> and <span class="smallcaps">subjective</span> components.</li>
<li><span class="smallcaps">linguisticality</span> is the human ability to communicate through a language, and a <span class="smallcaps">language</span> is a specific communicative system used by a specific group of humans.</li>
<li>If one defines <span class="smallcaps">linguisticality</span> as the human ability to communicate through a language, then saying that only humans have linguisticality is a tautology.</li>
<li>All living beings are capable of communicating.</li>
</ol>
