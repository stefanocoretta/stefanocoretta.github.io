<h1>Step 1: Choose the family of distributions</h1>
<p>The first step towards building a regression model is to choose the <strong>family of distributions</strong> the outcome variable (is believed to) belong to.</p>
<p>To start, is your outcome variable continuous or discrete?</p>
<div id="continuous-outcome-variable" class="section level2">
<h2>Continuous outcome variable</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The variable can take on <em>any positive and negative real number, including 0</em>: <strong>Gaussian</strong> (aka normal) distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are very few truly Gaussian variables, although in some cases one can speak of “approximate” or “assumed” normality.</p></li>
<li><p>This family is fitted by default in <code>lm()</code> and <code>brms::brm()</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The variable can take on <em>any positive number only</em>: <strong>Log-normal</strong> distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Duration of segments, words, pauses, etc, are known to be log-normally distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements taken in Hz (like f0, formants, centre of gravity, …) could be considered to be log-normal.</p></li>
<li><p>There other families that could potentially be used depending on the nature of the variable: exponential-gaussian (reaction times), gamma, …</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The variable can take on <em>any number between 0 and 1, but not 0 nor 1</em>: <strong>Beta</strong> distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proportions fall into this category (for example proportion of voicing within closure), although 0 and 1 are not allowed in the beta distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The variable can take on <em>any number between 0 and 1, including 0 or 0 and 1</em>: <strong>Zero-inflated</strong> or <strong>Zero/one-inflated beta</strong> (ZOIB) distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the proportion data includes many 0s and 1s, then this is the ideal distribution to use. ZOIB distributions are somewhat more difficult to fit than a simple beta distribution, so a common practice is to tranform the data so that it doesn’t include 0s nor 1s (this can be achieved using different techniques, some better than others).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="discrete-outcome-variable" class="section level2">
<h2>Discrete outcome variable</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The variable is <em>dichotomous</em>, i.e. it can take one of two levels: <strong>Bernoulli</strong> distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Categorical outcome variables like yes/no, correct/incorrect, voiced/voiceless, follow this distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>This family is fitted by default when you run <code>glm(family = binomial)</code>, aka “logistic regression”.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The variable is <em>counts</em>: <strong>Poisson</strong> distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Counts of words, segments, gestures, f0 peaks, …</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
