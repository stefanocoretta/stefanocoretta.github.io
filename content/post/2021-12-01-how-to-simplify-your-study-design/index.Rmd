We have all been there.

We run a study with a thought-out design: we got participants from the target population groups, each participant goes through the tasks of the study which gather data from several crossing conditions and now the time has come for you to run (the analysis) FOR. YOUR. LIFE.

And then THE HORROR.

You don't know how to deal with all of the conditions, your statistical models exude too many 3 or 4-way interactions, although in most cases they just don't converge... So you drop some interactions, but you feel you are doing something cheecky. Then you decide to conflate a few groups: that will at least reduce the number of values for some conditions.

But you just feel lost...

Unfortunately I do not have a simple solution to that.

Sorry to disappoint you! (But read on...)

Not all is lost!

Bescause now you are planning a new study. Starting afresh. After all... tomorrow is another day!

Here's a few tips on how to make your study design simpler and save your... face.

# Tips for a simpler design

## Think ahead about the statistical analysis

## Minimise the factorial design

## If you care about interactions, only include the critical ones in the model

## Make sure your factorial design is not "rank deficient"

# What to do if you really can't make it simpler

## Collect enough data

## Use dimentionality-reduction techniques

## Go Bayesian

# What to do if nothing works
