The following table lists common "portmanteau" names for linear models.
Note that different traditions/disciplines might use one particular name more often than the others.

My usual recommendation is to move away from using specific names like "logistic regression" or "mixed-effects models" and instead just specify what kind of components your linear model has (see the Description column in the table).

| Formula | Description | Names |
|-----|-----|---|
| `lm(y ~ x)` | Linear model with one predictor `x` using a Gaussian distribution for the outcome variable `y` | simple linear regression, simple linear model |   |
| `lm(y ~ x + z + ...)` | Linear model with two predictors or more using a Gaussian distribution for the outcome variable `y` | multiple linear regression, multiple linear model |
| `glm(y ~ x + ..., family = "binomial")` | Linear model with one or more predictors using a Bernoulli distribution for the outcome variable `y` | logistic regression, binomial regression, general(ised) linear model |
| `lmer(y ~ x + ... + (1 | z))` | Linear model with one or more predictors, including one or more random intercepts, using a Gaussian distribution for the outcome variable `y`. | mixed-effects models, nested models, hierarchical models, multilevel models, cross-effects models (plus combinations of those and "linear" or "regression") |
| `lmer(y ~ x + ... + (w | z))` | Linear model with one or more predictors, including one or more random intercepts and one or more random slopes, using a Gaussian distribution for the outcome variable `y`. | Same as above. Sometimes "random-slope models" |
| `glmer(y ~ x + ... + (w | z), family = "binomial")` | Linear model with one or more predictors, including one or more random intercepts and one or more random slopes, using a Bernoulli distribution for the outcome variable `y`. | Same as above, but includes "logistic", "binomial" or "general(ised)" in the name |
| `glm(..., family = "poisson")` | Linear model with one or more predictors, including one or more random intercepts and one or more random slopes, using a Poisson distribution for the outcome variable `y`. | Same as above but includes "Poisson" in the name |

**Note**: When specifying the binomial family in `glmer()`, the Bernoulli family is selected automatically under the hood
