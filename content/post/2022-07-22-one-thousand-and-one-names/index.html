<p>The following table lists common “portmanteau” names for linear models.
Note that different traditions/disciplines might use one particular name more often than the others.</p>
<p>My usual recommendation is to move away from using specific names like “logistic regression” or “mixed-effects models” and instead just specify what kind of components your linear model has (see the Description column in the table).</p>
