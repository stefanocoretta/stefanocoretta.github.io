[WORK IN PROGRESS]

My research interests span a range of topics within linguistics, although the main focus is on the study of speech sounds from a variety of intersecting perspectives, including acoustics, articulation, descriptive linguistics, historical linguistics (sound change), comparative linguistic (typology), and computational modelling. More specifically, most of my research centres around *speech production*.

## Projects

I am currently conducting research within the DFG project [*Nasal coarticulation and sound-change: a real-time MRI study*](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/nasal_coarticulation.html), and the ERC project [*Human interaction and the evolution of spoken accent*](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/erc_human_interaction.html) at the [Institut für Phonetik und Sprachverarbeitung](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/).
These projects employ real-time MRI data to investigate, among other things, how articulatory aspects of speech can pave the way for sound change.

### Past

As part of my PhD research at the University of Manchester, supervised by Dr <a href="http://www.bermudez-otero.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricardo Bermúdez-Otero</a> and Dr <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/patrycjastrycharczuk/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrycja Strycharczuk</a>), I investigated the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration, using a combination of acoustic analyses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_tongue_imaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrasound tongue imaging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroglottograph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electroglottography</a>.
My thesis is available <a href="https://stefanocoretta.github.io/docs/pubs/coretta-phd-thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Frameworks

In the following sections, I outline some of the conceptual and methodological aspects that fuel my research. I hope these will some day make it into a proper publication, after some more thorough thinking.

### Phonetology

In a wish to transcend the phonetics/phonology divide [@soskuthy2013; @ohala1990; @ohala2005], I refer to the set of sciences that investigate the *visual systems* (signing) and *sound systems* (speech sounds) of the world's languages with the term "phonetology" (from a combination of *phonet*ics and phon*ology*).

Although this newly-coined term contains the Greek root *phon-* 'sound', its meaning is by no means restricted to the realm of spoken languages, as its definition makes explicit. Sign languages, and other communicative systems yet to be "discovered", are included. The term "phonetological system" can be used as an umbrella term that covers both visual and sound systems.

### Phonetological systems

A *phonetological system* is comprised of a set of phonetological units and their relationships. Alas, I could not come up yet with a proper definition of "phonetological unit" that would subsume units of both visual and sound systems. Thoughts on this are much appreciated.

In my view of phonetology, a phonetological system has the following properties:

* It is a **dynamic system** [@thelen2006; @vihman2014].
* It is a **physio-neuro-cognitive** system. It has:
  * A **physical** component [@ohala1990; @ohala2005].
  * A **neuro-cognitive** component.
    * It is _rich_ in details [@johnson1997; @pierrehumbert2001; @bybee2002].
    * It is _self-organising_ and _emergent_ [@wedel2007; @wedel2011].
    * It uses both _stored exemplars and stored abstractions_ at multiple levels [@ambridge2020].
* It is part of a complex **socio-cultural system** [@boer2015; @foulkes2006; @thompson2016].

I also consider these statements to be extendible more generally to linguisticality [@haspelmath2020] as a holistic system.

### Linguistic diasystems

In light of the brilliant ideas expounded in @cysouw2013 and @rooy2021, I believe linguistics would benefit from a formalised notion of "language" in the sense of *linguistic system*.

@cysouw2013 propose a metamodel based on documentation, which formalises the notion of language using three concepts:

- **Glossonym** (p. 339)

  A *glossonym* is a name used to refer to a language, a lect, or a genealogically or areally related group of languages. A glossonym does not have a referent nor a significant, but rather it is just a signifier. For example, the glossonym *Altaic*, no actual reference is made to any linguistic entity, but only to the fact that this word has been used to refer to language-like entities.

- **Doculect** (p 342)

  A *doculect* (documented lect) is a linguistic entity as it is documented/described in a specific resource (book, paper, booklet, website, etc.). This term is agnostic as to the type of linguistic entity (family, language, variety, etc.). A doculect is a pairing of a glossonym and a resource. An example: [@howard1986; *mawayana*].

- **Languoid** (p. 347)

  A *languoid* refers to "any (possibly hierarchical) grouping of doculects, in principle ranging from a set of idiolects to a high-level language family" [@cysouw2013, p. 347]. An example:

  - <Coretta (2021); *mawayana*;
    - [@schomburgk1848; *mawakwa*, *maopityan*],
    - [@farabee1918; *mapidian*, *maopityan*, *moonpidenne*)],
    - [@howard1986; *mawayana*],
    - [@kaufman1994; *mapidian*, *mopidyán*],
    - [@aikhenvald1999; *mawayana*, *mapidian*, *mawakwa*],
    - [@carlin2006a; *mawayana*],
    - [@coretta2013; *mawayana*],
    - [@michels2014; *mawayana*]>

I propose the term "**dialang**" as an alternative to *languoid*. This is inspired by the Italian linguistic tradition, which speaks of "linguistic diasystems", where a **diasystem** is a system of systems. The term *dialang*, as *languoid*, can refer to any node within the grouping hierarchy, from higher- to lower-level groupings. Thus, the term *dialang* can refer to a macro-family, a family, a dialect continuum, a linkage, a language, a variety (whether diatopic, diachronic, diastratic, diaphasic, or diamesic), a register, an idiolect, etc.

In sum:

- A **dialang** is a hierarchical set of *doculects*.
- A **doculect** is a pairing of a *glossonym* and a *resource*.
- A **glossonym** is a name used to refer to a linguistic entity.
- A **resource** is any object (publication, media, etc.) containing linguistic materials.

### Research methods and Science

As far as research methods are concerned, I am an advocate of **Open Science**, a term which encompasses "concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge" [@cruewell2019] put to the service of "making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others" [@munafo2017].

## Languages

Among the languages I work(ed) with:

* Mawayana (Arawak) [[mapi1252](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mapi1252)].
* Santa Isabel languages (Oceanic) [[sant1458](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sant1458)].
* Lombard (Indo-European) [[lomb1257](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/lomb1257)].
* Icelandic (Indo-European) [[icel1247](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/icel1247)].
* Old Irish (Indo-European) [[oldi1246](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/oldi1246)].
* Albanian (Indo-European) [[alba1267](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/alba1267)].
* English: Mancunian English (Indo-European).
* Italian (Indo-European) [[ital182](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1282)].
* Polish (Indo-European) [[poli1260](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/poli1260)].
* German (Indo-European) [[stan1295](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/stan1295)].

In the earlier stages of my academic background, I was also exposed to (in random order and at varying degrees of depth) Sanskrit, Middle Egyptian, Classical Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Amharic, Hungarian, Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Oceanic, Middle Welsh, and Romani.

Overall, my interests and expertise cover the following linguistic families/groups:

- Indo-European.
- Oceanic.
- South American.

I would very much welcome offers of collaboration on languages from other areas of the world, especially languages of Africa, which are alas the ones I am the least familiar with.
