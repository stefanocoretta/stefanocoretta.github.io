My research focusses on *speech production*.
In particular, I am interested in the study of speech sounds from a variety of intersecting perspectives, including acoustics, articulation, descriptive linguistics, historical linguistics (sound change), comparative linguistic (typology), and computational modelling.

## Projects

As part of my PhD research at the University of Manchester, supervised by Dr <a href="http://www.bermudez-otero.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricardo Bermúdez-Otero</a> and Dr <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/patrycjastrycharczuk/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrycja Strycharczuk</a>), I investigated the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration, using a combination of acoustic analyses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_tongue_imaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrasound tongue imaging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroglottograph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electroglottography</a>.
My thesis is available <a href="https://stefanocoretta.github.io/docs/pubs/coretta-phd-thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am currently conducting research within the DFG project [*Nasal coarticulation and sound-change: a real-time MRI study*](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/nasal_coarticulation.html), and the ERC project [*Human interaction and the evolution of spoken accent*](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/erc_human_interaction.html) at the [Institut für Phonetik und Sprachverarbeitung](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/).
These projects employ real-time MRI data to investigate, among other things, how articulatory aspects of speech can pave the way for sound change.

## Languages

Among the languages I work(ed) with:

* Mawayana (Arawak) [[mapi1252](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/mapi1252)].
* Santa Isabel languages (Oceanic) [[sant1458](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sant1458)].
* Lombard (Indo-European) [[lomb1257](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/lomb1257)].
* Icelandic (Indo-European) [[icel1247](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/icel1247)].
* Old Irish (Indo-European) [[oldi1246](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/oldi1246)].
* English (Mancunian English, Indo-European).
* Italian (Indo-European) [[ital182](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1282)].
* Polish (Indo-European) [[poli1260](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/poli1260)].
* German (Indo-European) [[stan1295](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/stan1295)].

## Frameworks

My position regarding phonology (including phonetics) can be summarised as follows:

  * Phonology is a **dynamic system** [@thelen2006; @vihman2014].
  * Phonology is part of a complex **socio-cultural system** [@boer2015; @foulkes2006; @thompson2016].
  * Phonology is a complex **physical system** [@ohala1990; @ohala2005].
  * Phonology is a complex **neuro-cognitive system**:
      * It is _rich_ in details [@johnson1997; @pierrehumbert2001; @bybee2002].
      * It is _self-organising_ and _emergent_ [@wedel2007; @wedel2011].
      * It uses both _stored exemplars and stored abstractions_ at multiple levels [@ambridge2020].

I also consider these statements to be extendible more generally to Human Language as a holistic system.

As far as research methods are concerned, I am an advocate of **Open Science**, a term which encompasses "concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge" [@cruwell2019] put to the service of "making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others" [@munafo2017].
