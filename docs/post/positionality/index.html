In the other sense, it is an ever-changing document, since I will frequently change my mind about any part(s) of content herein. The following sections provide a thought-out description of my ontological and epistemological belief systems. The reader should interpret all of the statements made here as “my personal opinion”. In some cases opinion refers to my expert opinion, in others to my intuitions.1 With time, I will add references where/if relevant.\n1.1 Ontological linguisticality is the human ability to communicate through a language, and a language is a specific communicative system used by a specific group of humans (Haspelmath 2020). If one defines linguisticality as the human ability to communicate through a language, then saying that only humans have linguisticality is a tautology. All living beings are capable of communicating (even plants and fungi, Mancuso \u0026 Viola 2015). 1.2 Epistemological There is no agreement as to what science actually is. Science is not the only way to gain knowledge. Science has both objective and subjective components. Statistics and statistical inference have both objective and subjective components (Gelman \u0026 Hennig 2017). There is no agreement as to what language, human language, linguistic capacity, linguisticality actually are. There is no agreement as to whether language, human language, linguistic capacity, linguisticality are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities. There is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are innate and which are learned. There is no agreement as to what innate actually means. There is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely domain-specific or entirely domain-general, or if it is a bit of both. If it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are domain-specific and which are domain-general. There is no agreement as to what a language is. In fact, in English language is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written Language and language respectively).
