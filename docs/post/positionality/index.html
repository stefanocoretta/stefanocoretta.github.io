In time, I will add references to the statements, when relevant.\n1.1 Epistemological There is no agreement as to what science actually is. Science is not the only way to gain knowledge. There is no agreement as to what language, human language, linguistic capacity, linguisticality actually are. There is no agreement as to whether language, human language, linguistic capacity, linguisticality are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities. There is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are innate and wich are learned. There is no agreement as to what innate actually means. There is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely domain-specific or entirely domain-general, or if it is a bit of both. If it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are domain-specific and which are domain-general.  There is no agreement as to what a language is. In fact, in English language is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written Language and language respectively).   1.2 Ontological Science has both objective and subjective components. Statistics and statistical inference have both objective and subjective components. linguisticality is the human ability to communicate through a language, and a language is a specific communicative system used by a specific group of humans. If one defines linguisticality as the human ability to communicate through a language, then saying that only humans have linguisticality is a tautology. All living beings are capable of communicating (even plants and fungi).    ",
