    "text": "1 Five definitions of “random effect”\nIn his post, Gelman says that there are at least five possible ways of defining random effects (with others being subsumable under those five). To illustrate these definitions and make them more relatable to phoneticians and phonologists alike, I will make use of a fictitious study of f0 (fundamental frequency) as a correlate of emotional arousal (\\(\\eta\\)).\nLet’s assume that we are interested in testing the (made-up) hypothesis that emotional arousal affects the speaker’s f0. We can test this hypothesis using the following model:\n\\[ f0_{ij} = \\alpha + \\alpha_j + \\beta \\times \\eta_i \\]\nwhere\n\n\\(f0_{ij}\\) is the outcome variable,\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept,\n\\(\\alpha_j\\) is the individual speakers’ intercept coefficient,\n\\(\\beta\\) is the slope,\nand \\(\\eta_i\\) is emotional arousal status (0 = non-aroused, 1 = aroused).\n\nThe corresponding model in R:\nThis is just a model with a fixed effect and a by-speaker random intercept. The inclusion of speaker as a random effect is nothing exceptional, but what is a random effect?\nAs hinted at above, there is no one answer.\nThe following sections show how “speaker” can be interpreted as a random effect depending on which of the five definitions one picks.\n\n1.1 (1) Constant vs varying coefficients\nKreft, Kreft & de Leeuw (1998) distinguish between fixed and random regression coefficients. Fixed coefficients are constant across individuals, while random coefficients vary.\nIn the f0 study, the slope \\(\\beta\\) is fixed and \\(\\alpha_j\\) is random because it depends on which speaker the data is from.\n\n\n1.2 (2) Researcher’s interest\nSearle, Casella & McCulloch (2009: sec. 1.4) discuss effects in terms of the researcher’s interest. Effects are considered fixed if the research question/hypothesis being tested covers those effects, or random if the interest lies in the underlying population rather than on the individual effects.\nIn this sense, the effect of emotional arousal on f0 is the main focus of interest since we are testing the hypothesis that the former affects the latter, while the average f0 of each speaker (\\(\\alpha_j\\)) is not relevant.\n\n\n1.3 (3) Sampling\n\nWhen a sample exhausts the population, the corresponding variable is fixed; when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is random.\n\n—Green & Tukey (1960)\nIn our example study, the observed levels of emotional arousal (non-aroused vs aroused) exhausts the “population” of emotional arousal states, while the set of speakers is just a sample from the whole population of speakers.\n\n\n1.4 (4) Random events\n\nIf an effect is assumed to be a realized value of a random variable, it is called a random effect.\n\n—LaMotte (1983)\nA random variable is a variable generated by a random event.\nIn the f0 study, the speakers that participated in the study are the outcome of random events, while we assume that the relation between f0 and arousal is governed by a specific mathematical relationship.\n\n\n1.5 (5) Shrinkage\nThe last definition of fixed vs random effects is based on the method employed to estimate them. Fixed effects are estimated using maximum likelihood, while random effects are estimated with partial pooling. Partial pooling means that the estimation of the random effects influence the estimation of the fixed effects and vice versa. This definition is standard in the multilevel modelling literature (Snijders & Bosker 2011: sec. 4.2) and in econometrics.\nA consequence of partial pooling is the so-called “shrinkage”. Shrinkage refers to the “regression to the mean”, by which the estimated effects are attracted towards the overall mean (i.e. the intercept).\nSo in the f0 study, the by-speaker random intercepts “shrink” towards the estimated fixed intercept. In sum, fixed effects are effects without shrinkage while random effects are effects with shrinkage.\nThus, under this definition, whether one chooses to model an effect with or without shrinkage has to do with the underlying process model one expects to have generated the observed data. If the expected process of a variable entails shrinkage, then it would make sense to enter such variable as a random effect."

    "text": "When plotting tongue contours data obtained from ultrasound tongue imaging in R using ggplot2, a common option to smooth over the individual contours and show the general pattern is to use geom_smooth(methood = \"loess\"). However, as I will show in this post, in certain cases this method leads to very disorted contours. Such distortion is more or less always present, although at a lower degree in less extreme cases.\nTo show the shortcomings of using geom_smooth() and present a viable alternative, we’ll be using ultrasound tongue imaging data from one speaker (me). This dataset includes tongue contours from within the closure of the conosonants /t, d/ preceeded by /a, o, u/. The dataset looks like this (some columns dropped):\n\nselect(tongue_data, rec_date, fan_line, X, Y, word, vowel, c2)\n\n# A tibble: 1,239 × 7\n   rec_date            fan_line     X     Y word  vowel c2   \n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 29/11/2016 15:10:52        6  37.4  9.25 pada  a     d    \n 2 29/11/2016 15:21:30        6  38.6 13.1  pada  a     d    \n 3 29/11/2016 15:10:52        7  34.4 10.3  pada  a     d    \n 4 29/11/2016 15:11:03        7  34.3  9.81 pata  a     t    \n 5 29/11/2016 15:11:14        7  34.6 11.0  podo  o     d    \n 6 29/11/2016 15:13:39        7  34.3  9.65 pada  a     d    \n 7 29/11/2016 15:16:05        7  34.8 11.5  pada  a     d    \n 8 29/11/2016 15:17:07        7  34.5 10.5  putu  u     t    \n 9 29/11/2016 15:19:45        7  34.3  9.64 putu  u     t    \n10 29/11/2016 15:21:30        7  35.4 13.8  pada  a     d    \n# ℹ 1,229 more rows\n\n\nrec_date is the date and time of recording. Each observed tongue contour has a unique rec_date (this will come in handy later). fan_line is the number of the line in the fan coordinate system used by Articulate Assistant Advanced (which I used to record the data). X and Y are the horizontal and vertical position of each point on the contour. The unit is millimeters. word, vowel and c2 are self-explanatory.\nLet’s start by plotting the smoothed contours by vowel and consonant.\n\ntongue_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(X, Y)) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(colour = vowel), method = \"loess\") +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  facet_grid(c2 ~ vowel) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can immediately notice that with /u/ there is something odd going on. That does not look like a tongue surface (maybe that of a chameleon! Definitely not one of a ‘hooman’.) The smooths for /a/ and /o/ seem quite standard.\nTo see what is going on, let’s plot now also the individual points as recorded in the data, whith a superimoposed smooth, for comparison.\n\ntongue_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(X, Y)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(aes(colour = vowel), method = \"loess\") +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  facet_grid(c2 ~ vowel) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the smooths with /a/ and /o/ more or less have a good fit when compared to the points, with /u/ the smooths are really off.\nThis happpens because the tongue root (in this particular case) developpes vertically rather than slanted. The smooth isagnostic about the fact that points lying on the same X value but with different Y values belong to different portion of the tongue contour. The result is that smoothing happens across tongue parts.\nAn alternative (if you don’t like points) is to use geom_path() to plot the individual tongue contours as lines. geom_path() connects points with a line, following the order in which they appear in the dataset. So, before using this geometry, we need to arrange the dataframe such that the points are in the right order (now they are in the wrong order).\nTo do so, we can use rec_date (which identifies the individual contours) and fan_line which indicates the orders of points (for each contour, there a maximum 42 points/fan lines; NAs have been excluded).\n\ntongue_data &lt;- tongue_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(rec_date, fan_line)\n\ntongue_data\n\n# A tibble: 1,239 × 30\n   speaker seconds rec_date          prompt label TT_displacement_sm TT_velocity\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 2 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 3 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 4 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 5 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 6 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 7 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 8 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n 9 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n10 it01       1.11 29/11/2016 15:10… Dico … max_…               77.4       -7.18\n# ℹ 1,229 more rows\n# ℹ 23 more variables: TT_velocity_abs &lt;dbl&gt;, TD_displacement_sm &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TD_velocity &lt;dbl&gt;, TD_velocity_abs &lt;dbl&gt;, TR_displacement_sm &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TR_velocity &lt;dbl&gt;, TR_velocity_abs &lt;dbl&gt;, fan_line &lt;int&gt;, X &lt;dbl&gt;, Y &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   word &lt;chr&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, item &lt;int&gt;, ipa &lt;chr&gt;, c1 &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   c1_phonation &lt;chr&gt;, vowel &lt;chr&gt;, anteropost &lt;chr&gt;, height &lt;chr&gt;, c2 &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   c2_phonation &lt;chr&gt;, c2_place &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nWe can now use geom_path().

We can easily do that by grouping the data by fan_line and then summarise() it. Plotting can then be done with geom_path() and geom_polygon().

    "text": "The Italian Wikipedia has reached a number of 1,215,574 articles, with 1,247,172 registered users (source: Italian Wikipedia Statistics). That’s more or less one user per article. The Italian encyclopaedia counts an average of 358,814 views per hour (source: Wikipedia Statistics).\nNevertheless, the linguistics presence suffers from a variety of cyber-diseases. According to the figures described on the page of the Italian Linguistics WikiProject, out of 890 articles, 250 don’t cite proper sources for their information and about 270 are stubs that need to be expanded.\nBut one topic in particular has been recently called to our attention (I’m a Wikipedia editor myself): the “dialects of Italy.”\nThe problem is twofold: on the one hand, “dialects of Italy” refers to heterogeneous entities and, on the other, there is no agreement on how to define a “dialect” [nor a “language,” for that matter; see Cysouw and Good’s article about this, Cysouw & Good (2013)]. This is further complicated by the rooted misunderstanding of linguistics facts and concepts that the general public usually has.\nAll of this, together with the “poor sourcing” problem, led to chaos: see the lengthy discussion about what to call a dialect and what a language (the title Un argomento cruciale, ‘A critical topic,’ should be enough for grasping the seriousness of the matter).\nSome time ago, a decision has been made to use the term “language” for any linguistic entity that had a code from the ISO 639-3 (to be sure, that’s from Ethnologue, by SIL), and “dialect” for entities without a code. This created an inconvenient precedent: since no Italian scientific source uses labels like “Piedmontese language” (lingua piemontese) or “Calabrian language” (lingua calabrese), Wikipedia came to be a primary source of this use, thus contradicting one of the main tenets of the open encyclopaedia. That is: no original research (NOR).\nThe reaction of the laypeople is: “Wikipedia calls it a language, so it is indeed.” This is backed up by the (misled but widespread) notion of dialect as a “lower and/or corrupted variety of Italian,” further strengthened by the idea that Wikipedia is authoritative with no exceptions. But let me stress it again, no academic source labels the mentioned linguistic entities of Italy as “languages.” Sorry folks.\nBut why is that? Well, tradition. The dialects of Italy have been called that since long and it would be extremely difficult to ask Italian linguists to stop calling them that way. However, no (sensible) linguist would consider them as corruptions of the Italian language.\nAs an emblematic example, (Loporcaro 2009: 4–5) succinctly gives us an interesting perspective: “Derivando indipendentemente dal latino, i dialetti come il padovano, il napoletano ecc. sono lingue sorelle dell’italiano.” (trad: “Independently deriving from Latin, the dialects such as Paduan, Neapolitan, etc. are sister languages of Italian.”). Although Loporcaro stresses the fact that what are normally labelled as “dialects” are languages, he is probably forced to still call them “dialects.” The point is, no one has ever called the dialects of Italy using the apposition “language” (2018 EDIT: probably until recently): so no “Paduan language,” nor “Neapolitan language.” Hence, this use in Wikipedia is totally unjustified.\nLuckily, the trend in the encyclopaedia of abusing of the ISO 639 is in the process of being counteracted and some Wikipedians are making an effort to take the situation back under control. In the meantime, read the Cysouw and Good’s article mentioned early if you didn’t already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1 References\n\nCysouw, Michael & Jeff Good. 2013.

As aesthetics, you only need to specify the range of x values in aes(). Here, we use c(-4, 4), meaning that the x-axis of this plot will have these limits. For a normal distribution, it is useful to set the limits as the mean ± 4 times the standard deviation (this ensures all the distribution is shown).\nThe function ggplot2::stat_function() allows us to specify a distribution family with the fun argument.

    "text": "2.1 Treatment contrasts\nThe term treatment contrasts comes from the clinical sciences where you test, for example, the efficacy of a medical intervention (a drug, surgery, etc…) by comparing a control group (which has not received the “treatment”) with a group that has received the medical intervention (the treatment group).\nThe control group can be used as the reference group to see if the treatment group has benefited from the medical treatment (i.e. if the treatment group’s health has improved after the intervention relative to the control group, then one can infer that the treatment was effective).\nLet’s look at treatment contrasts in R.\nIn the previous section, we’ve been illustrating dummy coding by assigning 0s and 1s using one or more dummy variables. In practice, you do not need to do that to run real analyses, because R does that under the hood for you.\nFactors in R are coded with treatment contrasts by default. Also by default, the first level is set as the reference level (the order is alphabetical by default). The reference level is the level that gets coded only with 0s, as we have seen above for the dinosaur’s diet factor (carnivorous had dummy_1 = 0 and dummy_2 = 0).\nLet’s see an example using a data table with measurements of vowel duration.\n\nload(\"./data/vowels.rda\")\nglimpse(vowels)\n\nRows: 886\nColumns: 9\n$ item          &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 2, 11, 1, 15, 10, 13, 3, 14, 19, 4, 6, 16, 17, 5, 23…\n$ speaker       &lt;chr&gt; \"it01\", \"it01\", \"it01\", \"it01\", \"it01\", \"it01\", \"it01\", …\n$ word          &lt;chr&gt; \"pugu\", \"pada\", \"poco\", \"pata\", \"boco\", \"podo\", \"boto\", …\n$ v1_duration   &lt;dbl&gt; 95.23720, 138.96844, 126.93226, 127.49888, 132.33310, 12…\n$ c2_voicing    &lt;chr&gt; \"voiced\", \"voiced\", \"voiceless\", \"voiceless\", \"voiceless…\n$ vowel         &lt;chr&gt; \"u\", \"a\", \"o\", \"a\", \"o\", \"o\", \"o\", \"a\", \"o\", \"u\", \"a\", \"…\n$ c2_place      &lt;chr&gt; \"velar\", \"coronal\", \"velar\", \"coronal\", \"velar\", \"corona…\n$ speech_rate   &lt;dbl&gt; 4.893206, 5.015636, 4.819541, 5.031662, 5.063435, 5.0632…\n$ speech_rate_c &lt;dbl&gt; -0.55937531, -0.43694485, -0.63303978, -0.42091937, -0.3…\n\n\nFor example, let’s take the vowel column. This column indicates which vowel the measurement was taken from, and that can be /a/, /o/, or /u/.\nIf we convert the vowel column into a factor, the levels will be a, o and u, and a will be the reference level.\n\nvowels &lt;- vowels %&gt;%\n  mutate(vowel = as.factor(vowel))\n\nlevels(vowels$vowel)\n\n[1] \"a\" \"o\" \"u\"\n\n\nTo get a sense of how a factor would be coded with treatment contrasts, we can print a dummy coding table with the contr.treatment() function.\n\ncontr.treatment(levels(vowels$vowel))\n\n  o u\na 0 0\no 1 0\nu 0 1\n\n\nNow, let’s run a regression model with v1_duration as the outcome variable and vowel as the predictor.\n\nvow_lm &lt;- lm(v1_duration ~ vowel, data = vowels)\n\nsummary(vow_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = v1_duration ~ vowel, data = vowels)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-66.874 -22.567  -2.293  17.025 106.755 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

So o is 5.6 ms shorter than a on average (shorter because the coefficient is negative).\nFinally, the coefficient of u is the difference between the mean duration of u and the mean duration of the reference level a So u is 29.7 ms shorter than a.\nThis is how treatment contrasts work."

You just subtract the coefficients of both a and o from the grand mean: \\(116.8 - 11.8 - 6.1 = 98.9\\).\nIf you want to check that this is correct, the mean duration of u according to the model above where we used treatment contrasts was \\(128.616 - 29.763 = 98.853\\)."

So, on average, a vowel is about 13 ms shorter when followed by a voiceless stop.\nThe coefficients of vowel1 and vowel2 indicate the difference between the average vowel duration before a voiced stop (the Intercept) and a and o respectively. As before, to get the difference between the average vowel duration of u before a voiceless stop and the mean vowel duration, you just need to subtract the coefficients of vowel1 and vowel2 from the Intercept: \\(123.5 - 14.6 - 8.5 = 100.4\\).\nThe last two coefficients, c2_voicingvoiceless:vowel1 and c2_voicingvoiceless:vowel2 correspond to the difference in the effect of voicing between the average effect of voicing (c2_voicingvoiceless, i.e. -13 ms) and the effect of voicing in a and o respectively. That is, the decrease of vowel duration for a is 5.6 ms greater than the average effect, while the decrease of vowel duration for o is 4.8 ms greater than the average effect.\nFollowing the usual formula, the effect of voicing for u is \\(-13.309 - (-5.6) - (-4.8) = -2.9\\)."

But not so often we then think of the actual statistical analysis of the data we will collect based on the planned study design.\nThinking ahead about what type of analysis you will perform will help you figure out if perhaps the overall design is too ambitious and will give you the time to make changes to the design so that the data analysis will be easier.\nFor example, let’s assume we want to test people’s ability to recognise pitch differences across three different conditions. A set of recordings is played first with no background noise, then with white noise, and finally with a recording of people chatting in the background. We decide to have 30 trials in the no-noise condition (since this is just the baseline and we don’t need that many trials) and 50 trials in the other two conditions. After data collection you will compare the mean baseline of each subject with what happens in the other two conditions.\nYou start the study and collect data.\nNow it’s time to compare how the second and third condition differ from the baseline. You realise that you can’t simply compare the mean baseline, because you also want to account for the fact that listeners get attuned to the noise or task while performing it, so that later trials might show less of an effect. You could look at the change in performance of pitch change recognition across time within each condition, so that you can check if white noise and people chatter are different from the baseline condition with no noise.\nBut you have one problem…the number of trials are less in the baseline condition then in the other two conditions. It’s too late now!\nWhat the story teaches us is that, if we had carefully thought of the kind of analysis we wanted to do (i.e. compare the performance across time) we would have realised that to do so the number of trials needs to be the same.\nThis is why we always recommend thinking the specifics of the analysis before hand: why statistical model will you use? which predictors will be in the model? which data transformation will you apply? …"

    "section": "1.2 Minimise the factorial design",
    "text": "1.2 Minimise the factorial design\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother simple tip is to minimise the “factorial design” of the study.\nBy factorial design I mean the tabulated structure of conditions/groups/contexts that are controlled in the study.\nA simple factorial design is the following:\n\n\n\n\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n\n\n\n\nold\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a classic 2-by-2 design (\\(2 \\times 2\\)), with Age (young or old) and Place (city or village).\nYou plan to have 40 participants in total, which means these are the tabulated counts:\n\n\n\n\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n10\n10\n\n\nold\n10\n10\n\n\n\nBut you also want to know if level of education interacts with Age and/or Place. So you decide to go with this design:\n\n\n\nDiploma\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n\n\n\n\nold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n\n\n\n\nold\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now we went from a \\(2 \\times 2\\) to a \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2\\) design. Before we had 4 contextual combinations (young from the city, old from the city, young from the village, old from the village), but now we have 8 combinations.\nThe new design now would require us to be able to check three 2-way interactions and a 3-way interaction. Checking interactions requires sufficient data, and the more interactions you have and the higher the order of the interaction, the more data you need.\nSo assuming you had 40 participants in total, well distributed across the factorial design, that means that you are trying to estimate effects based on only 5 participants per combination.\n\n\n\nDiploma\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n5\n5\n\n\nold\n5\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree\ncity\nvillage\n\n\n\n\nyoung\n5\n5\n\n\nold\n5\n5\n\n\n\nIn fact, a \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2\\) design would already be an improvement on the average factorial design we normally employ in linguistics.\nLet’s think phonetics: 5 vowel qualities, 3 consonant places of articulation, 3 phonation types, 2 conditions of lexical stress, 3 prosodic conditions.\nWhich means you have to estimate 270 “cells” from the factorial table. A monster!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is immediately clear that this would not be feasible, at least with the limited time and resources we researchers have.\nSo, the moral of the story is: simplify your factorial design as much as possible, by focussing on those contexts that are critical to the research question.\nIn other words, don’t add contexts in just because “they are expected to make a difference”, if these are not the critical ones. Of course, any type of context can potentially make a difference, but if we had to control for all the imaginable contexts within a single study, we would be collecting data for centuries."

This means that for some of the quality/length combinations there won’t be any data.\nThe situation when a factorial design has some “cells” that are not represented in the data is described as rank deficiency. Or to put it differently, the data is rank deficient.\nThis is not a problem per se, since linear models can cope with rank deficient data, and you usually just get a warning from R.\nBut with more complex models, and especially if you are also including random effects, having rank deficient data can at times result in singular fit/non-convergence."

Depending on whether you will be using frequentist or Bayesian statistics, you have different options.\nTo know in advance how much data is enough when doing frequentist statistics, you will have to run a prospective power analysis. The main idea of a power analysis is that you pick the smallest meaningful effect size you want to be able to detect (i.e. p &lt; 0.05) and you can get an estimate of statistical power at varying sample sizes. Note that to be able to run a prospective power analysis you need to have a fair amount of information on the target population variance. Check out the simr package for power analyses in R.\nOne option if you will be using Bayesian statistics, is to define a Region Of Practical Equivalence (ROPE), which is a range of values around 0 that you would consider not to be meaningful (in other words, values below the smallest meaningful effect size). Then you can collect data until the Credible Interval width of the effect estimate of interest is equal or smaller of that of the ROPE. See a full description of this method in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2018.07.004."

This is the last resort.\nGo Bayesian.1\nBayesian statistics is a framework of statistical inference, in which uncertainty plays a central role.\nOne of the assets of Bayesian statistics is that you can get an estimate, not only of the effect of interest, but also of the uncertainty around that estimate in more intuitive terms than what you would get under a frequentist framework.\nNote that Bayesian statistics is not a different kind of test or set of models. You can run the same models you are familiar with (logistic regression, mixed-effects models, etc), but with a more robust estimation method.\nOne practical advantage of Bayesian statistics is that model convergence is rarely an issue. Even with very little data, the model will provide you with estimated effects.\nThe catch is that the less the data, the more the uncertainty.\nSo you will still get an estimate of the effect of interest even with little data, but that estimate will span a quite wide range of values.\nIf that will do for you and you don’t have the resources to collect more data or enough prior information to carry out prospective analyses, then you can be reassured that a Bayesian model will allow you to learn something from the data, even when you don’t have much of it.\nIf you worry about the uncertainty part of the deal, you should read this paper: https://doi.org/10.1515/ling-2019-0051.\nIf you wish to embark in the journey of learning Bayesian statistics, I recommend Statistical (Re)thinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan."

    "title": "On the phonotactic restrictions of Proto-Indoeuropean roots",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Proto-Indoeuropean lexicon is based on monosyllabic roots which have an alternating (ablaut) root vowel preceded and followed by consonants. In this post, I will share some thoughts on the phonotactic restrictions which seem to dictate which consonants can cooccur in a root. I will focus here on stops and laryngeal features. Although I have some formal training in Indoeuropean linguistics, what follows is more of an academic game, so I invite the reader not to expect a fully developed argument.\nThe traditional reconstruction of Proto-Indoeuropean (PIE) stops includes the following laryngeal oppositions:\n\nVoiceless unaspirated stops (T),\nVoiced unaspirated stops (D), and\nVoiced aspirated (murmured) stops (Dʰ).\n\nThe possible logical combinations of these laryngeal contrasts in a CVC- root, reviewed in Cooper (2009), are the following (the base ablaut vowel /e/ is used for illustrative purposes):\n\n\n\n\nT\nD\nDʰ\n\n\n\n\nT\nTeT\nTeD\n**TeDʰ\n\n\nD\nDeT\n**DeD\nDeDʰ\n\n\nDʰ\n**DʰeT\nDʰeD\nDʰeDʰ\n\n\n\nThe double asterisks signal those combinations which are not attested in the reconstructed PIE lexicon, namely **TeDʰ, **DED, and **DʰeT. Typologically, these restrictions, in combination with the reconstructed laryngeal oppositions, are somewhat baffling. There are no known languages which unequivocably contrasts voiceless stops with voiced stops and voiced aspirated stops.\nGamkrelidze & Ivanov (1994) and others have used this typological incongruence (with other aspects of the reconstructed PIE phonology) to argue that the reconstructed voiced (D) stops were in fact a type of ejective or glottalised consonants (which gave the name ‘Glottalic theory’). I’ll argue here that a reinterpretation of the restrictions seen above within Glottalic theory offers a sensible and more typologically grounded account of such restrictions.\nAccording to Glottalic theory, voiced stops (D) are glottalised consonants (T’), voiced aspirated stops (Dʰ) are voiced stops with aspirated allophones (D), and the voiceless stops are voiceless stops with aspirated allophones (T). The re-thought laryngeal contrasts thus are:\n\nVoiceless stops (T),\nVoiced stops (D),\nGlottalised (ejective) stops (T’).\n\nLet’s now rewrite the restriction table above:\n\n\n\n\nT\nT’\nD\n\n\n\n\nT\nTeT\nTeT’\n**TeD\n\n\nT’\nT’eT\n**T’eT’\nT’eD\n\n\nD\n**DeT\nDeT’\nDeD\n\n\n\nThe restriction **T’eT’ seems now more plausible, since it involves a typologically less common type of stop. (I remember from my time at the University of Pavia Prof. Gianguido Manzelli telling us there are American languages which have exactly this phonotactic restriction. Unfortunately I fail to remember which these are.) But what about **TeD and **DeT?\nIf we observe the attested combinations, a pattern emerges:\n\n\n\nT\nD\n\n\n\n\nTeT\nDeD\n\n\nT’eT\nT’eD\n\n\nTeT’\nDeT’\n\n\n\nThere seems to be an opposition between ‘T-roots’ and ‘D-roots’, where T’ stops are kind of neutral stops (they can appear in both type of roots). My thought on this is that, speculatively, the T~D contrast derives from an earlier suprasegmental contrast that was assigned to the root, rather than to the individual stops. This could have been something like stress, tone, pitch, or else (also, think about word-level nasality in South American languages, in which a word is either all nasal or oral).\nIf indeed roots could be specified as having the T feature (whatever that was) or the D feature, then it is possible that the glottalised (ejective) stops T’ were immune to changes acted by the root-level T~D distinction. Ejective stops in particular are strongly articulated consonants, and this might explain their resilience to being affected by suprasegmental properties of the root.\nThus, the reconstructed original laryngeal system might have contrasted voiceless stops and ejective stops. There is indeed a dozen languages with this system in South America alone (data from the SAPhon database v1.1.4), for example Alacalufe (Alacalufan), Chulupí (Mataco), and Selk’nam (Chon).\nAll this is of course internal reconstruction, so highly speculative, and as mentioned above, it is not meant to be more than brainstorming. I hope that the potential readers had fun reading this anyway and I am happy to hear about their thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1 References\n\nCooper, Adam I. 2009.

    "text": "1 The encounters\nThis is usually what happens: an academic makes a statement like “after all, if you are not interested in society, then why are you even bothering to do research in the first place!”. To which I reply: “well, I am not academically interested in society, although of course I recognise that Language is not in a societal vacuum and that learning about the societal aspects of it are important. It is just that I am not interested in that aspect of Language”. This is normally followed by a sort of contorted facial expression and then just plain dismissal.\nI cannot say it has happened many times (and precisely like how described), but it has happened enough for me to decide to write about it. I want to stress that I am not saying that none of us should be interested in society (academically or otherwise). What I want to argue here is that it is OK not to be interested in society while still doing sound research."

    "section": "2 Society is just one aspect",
    "text": "2 Society is just one aspect\nI very much agree that Language (in the sense of Haspelmath 2020) is not devoid of societal aspects and in fact I argue that society is a very important aspect of Language (see here). However, Language is made of many (interconnected) components [and I also believe that Language is more than the sum of its parts, see Thelen & Smith (1996), Thelen & Smith (2006); on this note, I want to highlight that I find the reductionist view of structuralism entertained by certain constructivist researchers to be problematic and based on a gross misunderstanding of structuralism, more on this in a work-in-progress paper with Jessica Hampton]: while understanding Language in its entirety of course require understanding society and its part in Language, I argue that an equally valid endeavour is to look at some components of Language while not considering the others (of course this will produce a limited view on such components, as much as just looking at society while rejecting any form of systematisation will produce a limited view).\nFor example, one of my academic interests is how speech gestures are cognitively organised and physically executed. This is an area of what I call phonetology on which there is still little agreement. An interesting aspect of the gestural organisation of speech is around what units organisation takes place and what type of hierarchies are involved in the organisation. An old hypothesis is that vocalic gestures take place at regular temporal intervals under certain constraints, and that other gestures are “overlaid” on them (Öhman 1966; Öhman 1967; Fowler 1980; Fowler 1983; Fowler 1992, see one of my presentations here).\nWhat ultimately makes this interesting to me is my own academic curiosity. I have no interest in its applications, nor in how this can help society. I am not saying that nobody should be interested in its application, I am just saying I am not. There will be at least one academic on Earth interested in how what we learn about gestural organisation can be used in technological applications, language pedagogy and so on."

Moreover, those academics and researcher that resonate with a “knowledge for knowledge’s sake” approach should not be subjected to dismissal by other members.\nTo conclude, I will just briefly mention something else, which is nonetheless related to the subject of this post: I’ve had academics assuming that my philosophical stance includes some form of positivism because they expect “quantitative methodologists” to automatically abide to such stance. This cannot be further from the truth. In fact, positivism is completely incompatible with my own philosophical stance and positionality, which are based on a syncretic synthesis of holistic monism, anti-realism, idealism, panpsychism, spiritualism and Bayesian epistemology."

The Humanities and Social Sciences can now benefit from such an abundance of data and integrate qualitative and quantitative methods.\nThis workshop introduces absolute beginners to computational principles and tools of data visualisation, processing, and exploration with the statistical software R.\nNo previous knowledge of quantitative analysis, statistics, nor programming required, just curiosity and a sense of adventure.\nYou can learn more about the workshop by visiting the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotelearnB4SS: Learn Bayesian Analysis for Speech Sciences\n\n\n\n Together with Timo Roettger and Joseph V. Casillas, we introduce the logic of Bayesian inference and compare it to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). After providing a brief conceptual introduction, the course walks through a Bayesian statistical analysis using R (R Core Team 2020) and the package brms (Bürkner 2018).\nWe explain how to set up a Bayesian regression model (including setting appropriate priors), how to interpret the results, how to diagnose model convergence, and how to visualize and report the results. In hands-on exercises, the participants immediately apply their knowledge to a speech data set in R.\nCheck out the workshop website for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteData Version Control for Researchers\n\n\n\nA fundamental aspect of Open Research is ensuring the reproducibility of data processing and analyses. Part of this endeavour is concerned with data versioning and backup. Many researchers have now become familiar with versioning systems like git, popularised by the GitHub online platform.\nThis workshop will introduce participants to the Data Version Control software (DVC), specifically designed to work efficiently with non-textual data types. DVC works in unison with git, so that git users can simply add it to their existing workflow and integrate code and data versioning.\nAfter a brief conceptual introduction to version control, git and DVC, participants are guided through a hands-on tutorial which teaches them the basics of git and DVC versioning using a toy project. Only basic familiarity with file management and command line is required (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/).\nFind here the workshop materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIntroduction to (Xe)LaTeX\n\n\n\nXeLaTex is is a mark-up language for text editing and typesetting (and more).

    "text": "After the post on the definition of random effects, I thought about writing another one on the definition of phonologisation.\nAs part of my PhD thesis on the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration, I briefly reviewed the five definitions of phonologisation I could find in the literature. This post includes text from my thesis and expands on a few points.\nThe main take-away of the sections to follow is that what one means with phonologisation is (unsurprisingly) dependent on the set of assumptions that are part of the framework within which the term is used. Secondly, these definitions are mutually exclusive, to an extent such that one’s argument based on one definition might be inappropriate under another definition. It is thus important to always contextualise the use of the term when employed, even when the meaning might be self-evident from the context."

    "title": "Bayesian CrI-width power analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post shows how to do a quick and dirty Bayesian power analysis.\n“Power” analysis might not be a very appropriate term when Bayesian statistics is concerned. A good alternative could be “precision” analysis, since the method presented in this post is about estimate precision.\nMore specifically, the aim of this type of analysis is to find the approximate minimum sample size required to reach a given level of precision. By precision, I mean the width of the posterior probability of the effect of interest and, by corollary, the widths of its Credible Intervals (CrI). The smaller the width of posterior/CrI, the greater the precision of the estimate.\nTo calculate the minimum sample size for a particular precision value, we can take advantage of the formula of the standard error of the mean:\n\\[\nse = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(se\\) is the standard error of the mean, \\(\\sigma\\) is the sample standard deviation and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nNote that in Bayesian statistics, the \\(se\\) is the standard deviation of the posterior probability of the effect of interest.\nIn the scenario of a power analysis, we want to know which \\(n_e\\) we need to get a specific \\(se_e\\). We can calculate the expected sample size \\(n_e\\) to get a specific \\(se_e\\) by plugging in the observed \\(se_o\\), the known sample size \\(n_o\\) and the chosen \\(se_e\\), in the following formula (which is derived from the standard error formula above).\n\\[\nn_e = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n_o} \\times se_o}{se_e}\\right)^2\n\\]\nLet’s see how to calculate \\(n_e\\).\nImagine you have fitted a Bayesian linear model to f0 values with formality as a predictor (formal vs informal speech). Let’s say the posterior probability of the effect of formality has a 95% CrI = [-10, +30] Hz, meaning that the standard deviation is 10 Hz. In total, there were 150 data points.\nSo, the observed standard error (i.e. the standard deviation of the posterior) is \\(se_o = 10\\), the sample size is \\(n_o = 150\\).\nThen we need to choose the standard error \\(se_e\\) we would want to be able to get if we ran a second iteration of the study. Let’s say we want an \\(se_e\\) of 5 Hz. Now, which is the \\(n_e\\) we need to get \\(se_e = 5\\)?\nEasy! We just plug in the numbers to get \\(n_e\\).\n\nn_o &lt;- 150\nse_o &lt;- 10\nse_e &lt;- 5\n\nn_e &lt;- ( ( sqrt(n_o) * se_o ) / se_e )^2\nn_e\n\n[1] 600\n\n\nThe sample size required to go from an \\(se_o\\) of 10 Hz to an \\(se_e\\) of 4 Hz is 600. 😱\nSo to get an \\(se\\) that is half of the observed one we would need 4 times the number of data points.\n\n1 Functions ex machina\nLet’s spice our coding up a bit and write a few functions we can use to calculate samples sizes for different &se_e$s.\nAlso, so far we’ve been talking about \\(se_e\\) or, in other words, the standard deviation of the of the posterior probability of the effect of interest. If you remember your probability 101, you should know that the width of the 95% CrI of a posterior probability is 4 times the standard deviation.\nSo let’s write a function to calculate \\(n_e\\) based on the width of the 95% CrI, rather than on the \\(se_e\\).\n\nestimate_n &lt;- function(obs_se, obs_n, width, divide = 1) {\n  sigma &lt;- sqrt(obs_n) * obs_se\n  se &lt;- width / 4\n  new_n &lt;- (sigma / se)^2\n  return(new_n / divide)\n}\n\nLet’s take it for a spin, using the numbers from the example above. The \\(se_o\\) we observed was 10 Hz, that’s corresponds to a width of \\(10 * 4 = 40\\) Hz. (Note that the first argument is the \\(se_o\\), not the width, but you can change that for consistency if you wish). The sample size \\(n_o\\) was 150. The \\(se_e\\) we want was 5 Hz, so the width is \\(5 * 4 = 20\\) Hz.\nLet’s plug in these numbers.\n\nestimate_n(obs_se = 10, obs_n = 150, width = 20)\n\n[1] 600\n\n\nAs we have already seen above, to get a 95% CrI width of 20 Hz, we would need at least 600 observations.\nNow let’s define a few functions that calculate the required sample size at different widths and create a plot.\n\nget_obs_range &lt;- function(obs_se, obs_n, min_width = 1, max_width, by = 1, divide = 1) {\n  obs_range &lt;- NULL\n  for (i in seq(min_width, max_width, by = by)) {\n    obs_range &lt;- c(obs_range, estimate_n(obs_se, obs_n, i, divide))\n  }\n  return(obs_range)\n}\n\nplot_obs_range &lt;- function(obs_se, obs_n, min_width = 1, max_width, by = 1, divide = 1) {\n  obs_range &lt;- get_obs_range(obs_se, obs_n, min_width, max_width, by, divide)\n\n  ggplot2::ggplot() +\n    aes(x = seq(min_width, max_width, by = by), y = obs_range) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_path() +\n    labs(\n      caption = paste0(\"SE = \", obs_se, \", \", obs_n, \" obs\"),\n      x = \"CI width\",\n      y = paste0(\"Estimated N \", \"(N/\", divide, \")\")\n    )\n}\n\nLet’s now plot the required sample sizes to reach a 95% CrI width in the range from 10 to 50, by 5.\n\nplot_obs_range(10, 150, min_width = 10, max_width = 50, by = 5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 3000, 250))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{coretta2022,\n  author = {Coretta, Stefano},\n  title = {Bayesian {CrI-width} Power Analysis},\n  date = {2022-04-05},\n  url = {https://stefanocoretta.github.io/posts/2022-04-05-bayesian-ci-width-power-analysis/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCoretta, Stefano. 2022.

The following strip chart show the number of speakers for each of the studies (each point) categorised by the endangerment of the language. Of course there are way more studies on safe languages, and if we focus on the first three categories of endangerment (safe, vulnerable, definitely endangered) there is a tendency to have a decreasing number of speakers. Considering though that we are talking of very low numbers of speakers (5-10) I am not sure it is actually relevant that definitely endangered languages have a lower median than safe languages. Difficult to say anything about higher endangerment levels given the low number of studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile of course making generalisations based on this cursory analysis would not be wise, there seems to be a tendency for studies to have a very low number of speakers (median 5 speakers over study).

    "text": "Linear models, aka linear regression models or regression models, are a group of statistical models based on the simple idea that we can predict an outcome variable \\(Y\\) based on a function \\(f(X)\\).\nThe “simplest” linear model is the formula of a line:1\n\\[\ny = \\alpha + \\beta x\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept of the line and \\(\\beta\\) the slope.\nThe principles behind this formula can be extended to represent virtually any other model, independent of the nature of the outcome variable(s) (\\(y\\)), the predictor(s), the types of relationship between outcome and predictor, and so on.\nThis means that if you master the principles of linear models, then you can virtually fit any kind of data using linear models You can bid farewell to ANOVAs, \\(t\\)-tests, \\(\\chi^2\\)-tests, and what not. In fact, these can all be thought of as specific cases of linear models. It just so happens that they got themselves a specific name. But the underlying mechanics is the same.\nSame goes with “regressions”, “logistic regression”, “generalised linear models”, “mixed-effects regression” and so on. These are all linear models, so they all follow the same principles. And again, the fact that they got specific name is a historical “accident”.\nUnderstanding that these named models are in fact all linear models gives you super powers you can use on data (Sauron would be so jealous):\n\nOne model to rule them all, one model to fit them,\nOne model to shrink them all, and in probability bind them;\nIn the Land of Inference where the distributions lie.\n\nEhm… perhaps this is not gonna win a poetry context, but…\nThe message is that with a single tool, i.e. linear models, you can go a long way!\nEach of the following sections asks you about the nature of your data and/or experimental design. By answering each, you will find out which “pieces” you need to add to your model structure.\n(This is a work in progress, so still rough around the edges)."

    "section": "1 What is literate programming?",
    "text": "1 What is literate programming?\nIn literate programming, one writes both code and plain text which explains what the code does in a single document. Natural language and programming language are interleaved in the document in a way that is reader-oriented, rather than software oriented. So, for example, the code can be included in an order that is different from the order it should have had the document been a script.\nThis programming paradigm allows developers to focus on documenting their code in a more natural way. This has the double advantage of aiding a new user in understanding what the code does and helping the author of the code to develop the code following a logic that can be different from the logic of the code’s programming language.\nIn general, from a literate source file (a file containing both natural language and programming code) it is possible to obtain a documentation file (by the process called weaving) and a script file (by the process called tangling) which is interpretable by the target programming language.\nMarkdown, a simple but effective mark-up language, allows mixing natural language (with rich formatting) and code in a single document. Pandoc is a software utility which can convert documents from and to a variety of formats. The conversion relevant to us is from Markdown to PDF. Converting Markdown to PDF corresponds to the weaving process mentioned above, i.e. creating a richly formatted documentation of the code. Pandoc has syntax highlighting capabilities, and Praat syntax is supported, so that your documentation will also be easier to interpret. The Literate Markdown Tangler, by Dave MacFarlane, is a software written in Go that instead can be used to tangle (extract) the code from the source file into a scripting file.\nPandoc and lmt can be used together to develop a literate programming workflow with Praat scripting. This means that you can develop a Praat script by laying out the pieces of the script in the source file and explain what the various parts of the script do in using natural language. lmt further allows the user to create “blocks” of code that can be referenced in other blocks and reused. If you wanna generate a PDF version of the documentation, you can convert the source file to a PDF with Pandoc.\nThe figure at the top of this post shows an example of a literate Praat source file.\nThe following sections will point you to the software and files that need to be installed/copied and will show how to use literate programming with Praat scripting."

Like all ways of knowing, science is human activity.\nI prefer to use the term research instead of science for all purposes.\nResearch has both objective and subjective components.\nStatistics and statistical inference have both objective and subjective components (Gelman & Hennig 2017).\nThere is no agreement as to what language, Human Language, linguisticality actually are.\nThere is no agreement as to whether language, Human Language, linguisticality are the same thing or if they in principle refer to different entities.\nThere is no agreement as to which components of the human ability to communicate through a language are innate and which are learned.\nThere is no agreement as to what innate actually means.\nThere is no agreement as to whether the human ability to communicate through a language is entirely domain-specific or entirely domain-general, or if it is a bit of both.\n\nIf it is a bit of both, there is no agreement as to which components are domain-specific and which are domain-general.\n\nThere is no agreement as to what a language is. In fact, in English language is used at times to mean either the human ability/capacity to communicate with a language or to mean a specific language (sometimes written Language and language respectively).

    "text": "Stefano Coretta\n[ˈsteˑfano koˈrɛtta]\nLecturer (Assistant Professor)\nUniversity of Edinburgh\ns.coretta@ed.ac.uk\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nI am a Lecturer (= Assistant Professor) in the Linguistics and English Language department of the University of Edinburgh (UK). As part of my duties, I develop and coordinate the statistical curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees within the department, teach statistics and research methods courses, and provide training for staff and students. I received my PhD degree in linguistics (with a thesis on ultrasound tongue imaging and electroglottography) from the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020. I was a postdoc researcher at the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Germany) from 2019 until 2021, when I joined the University of Edinburgh.\nI am available as instructor for a range of Workshops on statistics and research methods and as collaborator on projects or papers requiring the planning and execution of statistical analyses. Get in contact with me for info.\nMy past and current research covers different areas of linguistics, with a focus on phonetology—the study of speech sounds and their relation to Human Language—and research methods including statistics and Open Science practices (I am a signatory of Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science). For more details on my research interests, past/current research projects, and an overview of meta-models informing my research, check out the Research and Meta-models pages. You can find a list of research outputs (papers, software, etc) in Output.\nMy philosophical stance is based on a syncretic synthesis of holistic monism, anti-realism, idealism, panpsychism, subjective Bayesian epistemology and ecological awareness (I am a signatory of Open Sciences for a Post-Materialist Science). I engage in spiritual practices and pagan magick, and in my free time I enjoy conlanging (the art of constructing artificial languages), watching sci-fi and fantasy movies, playing the recorder and taking care of plants.\n\n\nInterests\n\nPhonetology (i.e. Speech, Phonetics, Phonology)\nResearch Methods and Statistics\nLanguage description\nTypology and Diachronic linguistics\nGraphemics\n\n\n\nPhD supervision\nI am available for PhD supervision on topics from my interests list. Please note that I do NOT supervise projects in applied, developmental linguistics, second language acquisition, English as a second language/TESOL."
