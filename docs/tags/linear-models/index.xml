      <description>Content Warning: there are A LOT of gifs in this post
We have all been there.
We have run a study with a thoroughly thought-out research design. We got participants from the selected target population. Each participant has gone through the tasks of the study, to gather data from several crossing conditions and now the time has come for you to run (the analysis) FOR. YOUR. LIFE.
And then THE HORROR.</description>

      <description>One model to rule them all Linear models, aka linear regression models or regression models, are a group of statistical models based on the simple idea that we can predict an outcome variable \(Y\) based on a function \(f(X)\).
The “simplest” linear model is the formula of a line:1
\[ y = \alpha + \beta x \]
where \(\alpha\) is the intercept of the line and \(\beta\) the slope.</description>
