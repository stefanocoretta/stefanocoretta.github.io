      <description>At least in linguistics, there is a general tendency to contrast theory with methods. This dichotomy is also reflected in the classification of academic papers as theoretical or methodological.
In this brief post I will argue that the theory/methods divide is epistemologically incoherent, and I will instead propose a taxonomy in which methods are subsumed under theory and are part of it.
