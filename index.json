In this post, I will share some thoughts on the phonotactic restrictions which seem to dictate which consonants can cooccur in a root. I will focus here on stops and laryngeal features. Although I have some formal training in Indoeuropean linguistics, what follows is more of an academic game, so I invite the reader not to expect a fully developed argument.\nThe traditional reconstruction of Proto-Indoeuropean (PIE) stops includes the following laryngeal oppositions:\n Voiceless unaspirated stops (T), Voiced unaspirated stops (D), and Voiced aspirated (murmured) stops (Dʰ).  The possible logical combinations of these laryngeal contrasts in a CVC- root, reviewed in Cooper (2009), are the following (the base ablaut vowel /e/ is used for illustrative purposes):\n   T D Dʰ    T TeT TeD **TeDʰ  D DeT **DeD DeDʰ  Dʰ **DʰeT DʰeD DʰeDʰ    The double asterisks signal those combinations which are not attested in the reconstructed PIE lexicon, namely **TeDʰ, **DED, and **DʰeT. Typologically, these restrictions, in combination with the reconstructed laryngeal oppositions, are somewhat baffling. There are no known languages which unequivocably contrasts voiceless stops with voiced stops and voiced aspirated stops.\nGamkrelidze and Ivanov (1994) and others have used this typological incongruence (with other aspects of the reconstructed PIE phonology) to argue that the reconstructed voiced (D) stops were in fact a type of ejective or glottalised consonants (which gave the name ‘Glottalic theory’). I’ll argue here that a reinterpretation of the restrictions seen above within Glottalic theory offers a sensible and more typologically grounded account of such restrictions.\nAccording to Glottalic theory, voiced stops (D) are glottalised consonants (T’), voiced aspirated stops (Dʰ) are voiced stops with aspirated allophones (D), and the voiceless stops are voiceless stops with aspirated allophones (T). The re-thought laryngeal contrasts thus are:\n Voiceless stops (T), Voiced stops (D), Glottalised (ejective) stops (T’).  Let’s now rewrite the restriction table above:\n   T T’ D    T TeT TeT’ **TeD  T’ T’eT **T’eT’ T’eD  D **DeT DeT’ DeD    The restriction **T’eT’ seems now more plausible, since it involves a typologically less common type of stop. (I remember from my time at the University of Pavia Prof. Gianguido Manzelli telling us there are American languages which have exactly this phonotactic restriction. Unfortunately I fail to remember which these are.) But what about **TeD and **DeT?\nIf we observe the attested combinations, a pattern emerges:\n  T D    TeT DeD  T’eT T’eD  TeT’ DeT’    There seems to be an opposition between ‘T-roots’ and ‘D-roots’, where T’ stops are kind of neutral stops (they can appear in both type of roots). My thought on this is that, speculatively, the T~D contrast derives from an earlier suprasegmental contrast that was assigned to the root, rather than to the individual stops. This could have been something like stress, tone, pitch, or else (also, think about word-level nasality in South American languages, in which a word is either all nasal or oral).\nIf indeed roots could be specified as having the T feature (whatever that was) or the D feature, then it is possible that the glottalised (ejective) stops T’ were immune to changes acted by the root-level T~D distinction. Ejective stops in particular are strongly articulated consonants, and this might explain their resilience to being affected by suprasegmental properties of the root.\nThus, the reconstructed original laryngeal system might have contrasted voiceless stops and ejective stops. There is indeed a dozen languages with this system in South America alone (data from the SAPhon database v1.1.4), for example Alacalufe (Alacalufan), Chulupí (Mataco), and Selk’nam (Chon).\nAll this is of course internal reconstruction, so highly speculative, and as mentioned above, it is not meant to be more than brainstorming. I hope that the potential readers had fun reading this anyway and I am happy to hear about their thoughts.\nReferences Cooper, Adam I. 2009. “Similarity Avoidance in the Proto-Indo-European Root.” University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (1): 8.\n Gamkrelidze, Thomas Valerianis, and Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich Ivanov. 1994.

However, as I will show in this post, in certain cases this method leads to very disorted contours. Such distortion is more or less always present, although at a lower degree in less extreme cases.\nTo show the shortcomings of using geom_smooth() and present a viable alternative, we’ll be using ultrasound tongue imaging data from one speaker (me). This dataset includes tongue contours from within the closure of the conosonants /t, d/ preceeded by /a, o, u/. The dataset looks like this (some columns dropped):\nselect(tongue_data, rec_date, fan_line, X, Y, word, vowel, c2) ## # A tibble: 1,239 x 7 ## rec_date fan_line X Y word vowel c2 ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 29/11/2016 15:10:52 6 37.4 9.25 pada a d ## 2 29/11/2016 15:21:30 6 38.6 13.1 pada a d ## 3 29/11/2016 15:10:52 7 34.4 10.3 pada a d ## 4 29/11/2016 15:11:03 7 34.3 9.81 pata a t ## 5 29/11/2016 15:11:14 7 34.6 11.0 podo o d ## 6 29/11/2016 15:13:39 7 34.3 9.65 pada a d ## 7 29/11/2016 15:16:05 7 34.8 11.5 pada a d ## 8 29/11/2016 15:17:07 7 34.5 10.5 putu u t ## 9 29/11/2016 15:19:45 7 34.3 9.64 putu u t ## 10 29/11/2016 15:21:30 7 35.4 13.8 pada a d ## # … with 1,229 more rows rec_date is the date and time of recording. Each observed tongue contour has a unique rec_date (this will come in handy later). fan_line is the number of the line in the fan coordinate system used by Articulate Assistant Advanced (which I used to record the data). X and Y are the horizontal and vertical position of each point on the contour. The unit is millimeters. word, vowel and c2 are self-explanatory.\nLet’s start by plotting the smoothed contours by vowel and consonant.\ntongue_data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(X, Y)) + geom_smooth(aes(colour = vowel), method = \u0026quot;loess\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + facet_grid(c2 ~ vowel) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) We can immediately notice that with /u/ there is something odd going on. That does not look like a tongue surface (maybe that of a chameleon! Definitely not one of a ‘hooman’.) The smooths for /a/ and /o/ seem quite standard.\nTo see what is going on, let’s plot now also the individual points as recorded in the data, whith a superimoposed smooth, for comparison.\ntongue_data %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(X, Y)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + geom_smooth(aes(colour = vowel), method = \u0026quot;loess\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + facet_grid(c2 ~ vowel) + theme(legend.position = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) While the smooths with /a/ and /o/ more or less have a good fit when compared to the points, with /u/ the smooths are really off.\nThis happpens because the tongue root (in this particular case) developpes vertically rather than slanted. The smooth isagnostic about the fact that points lying on the same X value but with different Y values belong to different portion of the tongue contour. The result is that smoothing happens across tongue parts.\nAn alternative (if you don’t like points) is to use geom_path() to plot the individual tongue contours as lines. geom_path() connects points with a line, following the order in which they appear in the dataset. So, before using this geometry, we need to arrange the dataframe such that the points are in the right order (now they are in the wrong order).\nTo do so, we can use rec_date (which identifies the individual contours) and fan_line which indicates the orders of points (for each contour, there a maximum 42 points/fan lines; NAs have been excluded).\ntongue_data \u0026lt;- tongue_data %\u0026gt;% arrange(rec_date, fan_line) tongue_data ## # A tibble: 1,239 x 30 ## speaker seconds rec_date prompt label TT_displacement… TT_velocity ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 2 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 3 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 4 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 5 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 6 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 7 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 8 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 9 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## 10 it01 1.11 29/11/2… Dico … max_… 77.4 -7.18 ## # … with 1,229 more rows, and 23 more variables: TT_velocity_abs \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # TD_displacement_sm \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, TD_velocity \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, TD_velocity_abs \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # TR_displacement_sm \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, TR_velocity \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, TR_velocity_abs \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # fan_line \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;, X \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, Y \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, word \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, language \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # sex \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, item \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;, ipa \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, c1 \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, c1_phonation \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # vowel \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, anteropost \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, height \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, c2 \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # c2_phonation \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, c2_place \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; We can now use geom_path().

We can easily do that by grouping the data by fan_line and then summarise() it. Plotting can then be done with geom_path() and geom_polygon().

It’s a toy dataset of course, just for purpose of illustration, so not very exciting!\nThe values for each 5% interval for each formant are in separate columns. For plotting and modelling, though, we need the data to be in a ‘tidy’ format (Wickham 2014):\n each observation unit is in a separate row each variable is a separate column  In our case, each observation unit is a 5% interval. As for the variables, they are: time in the recording, word, vowel, vowel duration, F1, F2, and F3.\nThe first step towards a long format data set is to gather all the columns that have formant values to a column indicating the formant plus interval (like ‘F1_05’) and the value of that formant in that interval. We can use gather() for this.\nIn the following chunks, I will illustrate the results of each step separately by saving the output of the functions to variables.

That’s more or less one user per article. The Italian encyclopaedia counts an average of 358,814 views per hour (source: Wikipedia Statistics).\nNevertheless, the linguistics presence suffers from a variety of cyber-diseases. According to the figures described on the page of the Italian Linguistics WikiProject, out of 890 articles, 250 don’t cite proper sources for their information and about 270 are stubs that need to be expanded.\nBut one topic in particular has been recently called to our attention (I’m a Wikipedia editor myself): the “dialects of Italy.”\nThe problem is twofold: on the one hand, “dialects of Italy” refers to heterogeneous entities and, on the other, there is no agreement on how to define a “dialect” (nor a “language,” for that matter; see Cysouw and Good’s article about this, Cysouw and Good 2013). This is further complicated by the rooted misunderstanding of linguistics facts and concepts that the general public usually has.\nAll of this, together with the “poor sourcing” problem, led to chaos: see the lengthy discussion about what to call a dialect and what a language (the title Un argomento cruciale, ‘A critical topic,’ should be enough for grasping the seriousness of the matter).\nSome time ago, a decision has been made to use the term “language” for any linguistic entity that had a code from the ISO 639-3 (to be sure, that’s from Ethnologue, by SIL), and “dialect” for entities without a code. This created an inconvenient precedent: since no Italian scientific source uses labels like “Piedmontese language” (lingua piemontese) or “Calabrian language” (lingua calabrese), Wikipedia came to be a primary source of this use, thus contradicting one of the main tenets of the open encyclopaedia. That is: no original research (NOR).\nThe reaction of the laypeople is: “Wikipedia calls it a language, so it is indeed.” This is backed up by the (misled but widespread) notion of dialect as a “lower and/or corrupted variety of Italian,” further strengthened by the idea that Wikipedia is authoritative with no exceptions. But let me stress it again, no academic source labels the mentioned linguistic entities of Italy as “languages.” Sorry folks.\nBut why is that? Well, tradition. The dialects of Italy have been called that since long and it would be extremely difficult to ask Italian linguists to stop calling them that way. However, no (sensible) linguist would consider them as corruptions of the Italian language.\nAs an emblematic example, (Loporcaro 2009, 4–5) succinctly gives us an interesting perspective: “Derivando indipendentemente dal latino, i dialetti come il padovano, il napoletano ecc. sono lingue sorelle dell’italiano.” (trad: “Independently deriving from Latin, the dialects such as Paduan, Neapolitan, etc. are sister languages of Italian.”). Although Loporcaro stresses the fact that what are normally labelled as “dialects” are languages, he is probably forced to still call them “dialects.” The point is, no one has ever called the dialects of Italy using the apposition “language” (2018 EDIT: probably until recently): so no “Paduan language,” nor “Neapolitan language.” Hence, this use in Wikipedia is totally unjustified.\nLuckily, the trend in the encyclopaedia of abusing of the ISO 639 is in the process of being counteracted and some Wikipedians are making an effort to take the situation back under control. In the meantime, read the Cysouw and Good’s article mentioned early if you didn’t already.\nReferences Cysouw, Michael, and Jeff Good. 2013. “Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion ‘Language’.” Language Documentation \u0026amp; Conservation 7: 331–59. https://doi.org/10125/4606.\n Loporcaro, Michele. 2009.
