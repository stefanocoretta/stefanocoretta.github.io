<br>

I am a Lecturer (Assitant Professor) in the [Linguistics and English Language department](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language) of the University of Edinburgh (UK). As part of my duties, I develop and coordinate the statistical curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees within the department, teach statistics and research methods courses, and provide training for staff and students.

I am available as **instructor for a range of [Workshops](teaching.qmd#workshops)** on statistics and research methods and as **collaborator on projects or papers** requiring the planning and execution of statistical analyses. Get in contact with me for info.

My past and current research covers different areas of *linguistics*, with a focus on [[phonetology]{.smallcaps}](meta.qmd#phonetology)---the study of speech sounds and their relation to *linguisticality* (Human Language, see [Haspelmath 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03056))---and [[research methods]{.smallcaps}](meta.qmd#research-methods) including statistics and Open Science practices. For more details on my research interests, past/current research projects, and an overview of meta-models informing my research, check out the [Research](research.qmd) and [Meta-models](meta.qmd) pages. You can find a list of research outputs (papers, software, etc) in [Output](output/index.qmd).

I received my PhD degree in linguistics from the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020. I was a postdoc researcher at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Germany) from 2019 until 2021.
