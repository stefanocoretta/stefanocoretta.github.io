I am the Senior Teaching Coordinator for Statistics (**Teaching Fellow, Tenured**) in the [Linguistics and English Language department](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/linguistics-and-english-language) of the University of Edinburgh (UK).
As part of my duties, I coordinate the statistical curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees within the department, teach statistics and research methods courses, and provide training for staff and students.

I am available as instructor for a range of [Workshops](teaching.qmd#workshops) on statistics and research methods and as collaborator on projects or papers requiring the planning and execution of statistical analyses. Get in contact with me for info.

My past and current research covers different areas of *linguistics*, with a focus on <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[phonetology](meta.qmd#phonetology)</span>---the study of speech sounds and their relation to *linguisticality* (Human Language, see [Haspelmath 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03056))---and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">[research methods](meta.qmd#research-methods)</span> including statistics and Open Science practices.
For more details on my research interests, past/current research projects, and an overview of meta-models informing my research, check out the [Research](research.qmd) and [Meta-models](meta.qmd) pages.
You can find a list of research outputs (papers, software, etc) in [Output](output/index.qmd).

I received my PhD degree in linguistics from the University of Manchester (UK) in 2020.
I was a postdoc researcher at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (Germany) from 2019 until 2021.
