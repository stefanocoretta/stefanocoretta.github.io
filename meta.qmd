In the following sections, I outline some of the conceptual and methodological aspects ([meta-models]{.smallcaps}) that fuel and back-up my research. I hope these will some day make it into a proper publication, after some more thorough thinking.

# Research methods

As far as research methods are concerned, I am an enthusiastic advocate of **Open Research**, a term which encompasses "concepts of openness, transparency, rigor, reproducibility, replicability, and accumulation of knowledge" [@cruewell2019] put to the service of "making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others" [@munafo2017].[^1]

[^1]: *Open Research* is a more inclusive term than the more common *Open Science* term.

I am also a supporter of the **Slow Science** movement, part of the broader "slow" movement (as in "slow-food"), which can be summarised with this quote from the [manifesto](http://slow-science.org): "We do need time to think. We do need time to digest. We do need time to misunderstand each other".

<!-- TODO: ethics -->

<!-- TODO: research project management -->

<!-- TODO: methods as theory, theory = concepts + methods, theory and applications, basic science and applied science -->

<!-- TODO: statistics -->

<!-- TODO: philosophy of science: three books -->

Philosophy and science might seem two very unrelated fields, but in fact **philosophy of science** is an extremely important intersection of the two, with broad implications for research methods, from experiment planning, through statistical modelling, to inference. I'll expand on this some time in the future, but for now I can strongly recommend the following books:

-   *Philosophy of science: Very short introduction* [@okasha2016].
-   *Understanding psychology as a science: An introduction to scientific and statistical inference* [@dienes2008].
-   *The Systems View of life: A unifying vision* [@capra2018].

# Phonetology

In a wish to transcend the phonetics/phonology divide [@soskuthy2013; @ohala1990; @ohala2005], I refer to the set of sciences that investigate the [visual systems]{.smallcaps} (signing) and [sound systems]{.smallcaps} (speech sounds) of the world's languages with the term [phonetology]{.smallcaps} (from a combination of *phonet*ics and phon*ology*).

Although this newly-coined term contains the Greek root *phon-* 'sound', its meaning is by no means restricted to the realm of spoken languages, as its definition makes explicit. Sign languages, and other communicative systems yet to be "discovered", are included. The term [phonetological system]{.smallcaps} can be used as an umbrella term that covers both visual and sound systems.

# Phonetological systems

A *phonetological system* is comprised of a set of [phonetological units]{.smallcaps} and their [relationships]{.smallcaps}. Alas, I could not come up yet with a proper definition of "phonetological unit" that would subsume units of both visual and sound systems. Thoughts on this are much appreciated.

In my view of phonetology, a phonetological system has the following properties:

-   It is a **dynamic system** [@thelen2006; @vihman2014].
-   It is a **physio-neuro-cognitive** system. It has:
    -   A **physical** component [@ohala1990; @ohala2005].
    -   A **neuro-cognitive** component.
        -   It is *rich* in details [@johnson1997; @pierrehumbert2001; @bybee2002].
        -   It is *self-organising* and *emergent* [@wedel2007; @wedel2011].
        -   It uses both *stored exemplars and stored abstractions* at multiple levels [@ambridge2020].
-   It is part of a complex **socio-cultural system** [@boer2015; @foulkes2006; @thompson2016].

I also consider these statements to be extendible more generally to linguisticality [@haspelmath2020] as a holistic system.

# Linguistic systems

In light of the brilliant ideas expounded in @cysouw2013 and @rooy2021, I believe linguistics would benefit from a formalised notion of [linguistic system]{.smallcaps} that would encompass any kind of system, from linguistic families down to idiolects, and any type of variation.

@cysouw2013 propose a meta-model based on linguistic documentation and description. From this model, I borrow two concepts:

-   **Glossonym** (p. 339)

    A [glossonym]{.smallcaps} is a name (noun) used to refer to a linguistic system, whether a language, a lect, or a genealogically or areally related group of languages. A glossonym does not have a referent nor a significant, but rather it is just a signifier. For example, the glossonym *Altaic*, no actual reference is made to any linguistic entity, but only to the fact that this word has been used to refer to linguistic systems.

-   **Doculect** (p 342)

    A [doculect]{.smallcaps} (i.e. documented lect) is a linguistic entity as it is documented/described in a specific resource (book, paper, booklet, website, etc.). This term is agnostic as to the type of linguistic entity (family, language, variety, etc.). A doculect is the pairing of a glossonym and a resource. An example: [@howard1986; *mawayana*].

@cysouw2013 [p. 347] also introduce the concept of "languoid" which refers to "any (possibly hierarchical) grouping of doculects, in principle ranging from a set of idiolects to a high-level language family".

I propose instead the term [glossolect]{.smallcaps}, which---unlike languoid---does not necessarily entail a strictly-nested hierarchical structure. This difference accommodates those cases where linguistic grouping is not based on clear-cut splits, but rather based on a network of shared features (cases which are possibly more frequent), in which a doculect can in fact belong to different intersecting glossolects.

A glossolect is thus a set of doculects and can refer to any of a macro-family, a family, a dialect continuum, a linkage, a language, a variety, an idiolect, etc.

In terms of types of linguistic variation, I borrow from classical sociolinguistics (references TBA):

-   **Diachronic**: variation in *time*.
-   **Diatopic**: variation in *geographical space* (less frequently used is **diachoric** for more restricted spatial variation).
-   **Diastratic**: variation based on *social class and groups*.
-   **Diaphasic**: variation based on *linguistic and social context* (includes *registers* and *slangs*).
-   **Diamesic**: variation based on the *means of communication* (e.g., visual/oral vs written, web vs print, etc.).

In sum:

-   A **glossolect** is a set of *doculects*.
-   A **doculect** is a pairing of a *glossonym* and a *resource*.
-   A **glossonym** is a name used to refer to a linguistic entity.
-   A **resource** is any object (publication, media, etc.) containing linguistic materials.
-   Glossolects can be situated within a specific **diachronic, diatopic, diastratic, diaphasic, diamesic** context.
