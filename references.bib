  abstract = {`Theory' is one of the most important words in the lexicon of contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite unclear what sociologists mean by the words `theory,' `theoretical,' and `theorize.' I argue that confusions about the meaning of `theory' have brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions: (a) what does `theory' mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what ought `theory' to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about `theory.' Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology to. Fourth, I articulate the question, `what ought ``theory'' to mean?,' which I dub the `semantic predicament' (SP), and I consider what one can learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a semantic therapy` for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP: (a) the principle of practical reason---SP is to a large extent a political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological pluralism---the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and epistemologically demanding.},

  abstract = {Initiating or maintaining phonation during stop closure involves several adjustments, including tongue root advancement to enlarge oral cavity volume (Westbury 1983). Ultrasound imaging shows that in English, the tongue is more advanced for phonologically voiced stops, whether phonated or unphonated (Ahn 2015). The current study uses ultrasound to examine tongue positioning during Hindi stops. Hindi has a unique four-way laryngeal contrast: voiced, murmured, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated. Eight native Hindi speakers recorded phrase-initial stops at three places of articulation (labial, dental, velar) followed by the low vowel /a/. Results show a clear distinction in tongue position between voiced and voiceless unaspirated/aspirated stops. The tongue root is advanced for voiced stops in comparison to voiceless stops. However, there is no difference in tongue root position between voiceless unaspirated and aspirated stops. Murmured stops showed variation among speakers in comparison to other stops, while the majority of speakers show more advanced tongue root compared to voiceless stops. The results suggest that tongue root advancement facilitates phonation in Hindi. Thus, in Hindi, tongue root position corresponds to a phonological distinction in phonation most notably between voiced unaspirated stops and voiceless stops, whereas in English, tongue root position reflects a more abstract phonological distinction in voicing that does not correspond to phonation.}

  abstract = {For aging speech, there is limited knowledge regarding the articulatory adjustments underlying the acoustic findings observed in previous studies. In order to investigate the agerelated articulatory differences in European Portuguese (EP) vowels, the present study analyzes the tongue configuration of the nine EP oral vowels (isolated context and pseudoword context) produced by 10 female speakers of two different age groups (young and old). From the tongue contours automatically segmented from the US images and manually revised, the parameters (tongue height and tongue advancement) were extracted. The results suggest that the tongue tends to be higher and more advanced for the older females compared to the younger ones for almost all vowels. Thus, the vowel articulatory space tends to be higher, advanced, and bigger with age. For older females, unlike younger females that presented a sharp reduction in the articulatory vowel space in disyllabic sequences, the vowel space tends to be more advanced for isolated vowels compared with vowels produced in disyllabic sequences. This study extends our pilot research by reporting articulatory data from more speakers based on an improved automatic method of tongue contours tracing, and it performs an inter-speaker comparison through the application of a novel normalization procedure.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

Although observational causal inference methodologies exist, predictive techniques such as model selection based on information criterion (e.g. AIC) remains a common approach used to understand ecological relationships. However, predictive approaches are not appropriate for drawing causal conclusions. Here, we highlight the distinction between predictive and causal inference and show how predictive techniques can lead to biased causal estimates. Instead, we encourage ecologists to valid causal inference methods such as the backdoor criterion, a graphical rule that can be used to determine causal relationships across observational studies.},

  abstract = {Why are children better language learners than adults despite being worse at a range of other cognitive tasks? Understanding this can shed new light on the process of first language acquisition and how it differs from that of second language learning, while also providing us with additional tools for teaching second languages effectively. Many accounts focus on the cognitive or neurological differences between children and adults, which are in many ways irreversible. In my work, I focus instead on the way prior knowledge impacts the linguistic building blocks that children and adults use during learning, and how those early building blocks impact learning outcomes. I propose and test the Starting Big Hypothesis: the idea that children's advantage is related to their greater engagement with whole-to-part learning. Specifically, I propose that children rely on both single words and multiword units during learning, while adults do so less (because of their prior knowledge of words), and that this difference can explain (some of) adults' difficulty in learning the grammatical relations between words. I draw on developmental, psycholinguistic and computational findings to show that multiword units are integral building blocks in language; that such units are facilitative for learning certain grammatical relations; and that adult learners rely on them less than children, a pattern that can explain differences between L1 and L2 learning. I will end by discussing implications for models of L1 and L2 learning and the possible role of whole-to-part learning in the emergence of linguistic structure.}

  abstract = {Understanding exam score distributions has implications for item response theory (IRT), grade curving, and downstream modeling tasks such as peer grading. Historically, grades have been assumed to be normally distributed, and to this day the normal is the ubiquitous choice for modeling exam scores. While this is a good assumption for tests comprised of equally-weighted dichotomous items, it breaks down on the highly polytomous domain of undergraduate-level exams. The logit-normal is a natural alternative because it is has a bounded range, can represent asymmetric distributions, and lines up with IRT models that perform logistic transformations on normally distributed abilities. To tackle this question, we analyze an anonymized dataset from Gradescope consisting of over 4000 highly polytomous undergraduate exams. We show that the logit-normal better models this data without having more parameters than the normal. In addition, we propose a new continuous polytomous IRT model that reduces the number of item-parameters by using a logit-normal assumption at the item level.},

But it's not just a question of letting the weeds take over - there's an art and balance to rewilding a garden well so that you can enjoy it too. The Butterfly Brothers are experts at designing wildlife-friendly gardens, and in Wild Your Garden, they show you how to work with nature, support wildlife, and create a self-maintaining, no-dig balance of planting. Transform a paved-over yard into a lush oasis, create refuges to welcome endangered species, or change a high-maintenance lawn into a mini-meadow with the potential to absorb carbon and air pollution. The projects don't require specialist gardening knowledge or lots of land, so whatever size space you have, you can rewild your own little corner of the planet. Most importantly, Wild Your Garden will show you the beauty and rewards of sharing your space with nature},

This article distinguishes each of the above as a basic source of knowledge, with the exception of memory. Memory, while a basic source of justification, plays a preservative rather than a generative role in knowledge. This article contrasts basic sources with nonbasic sources, concentrating on testimony. After clarifying the relationship between a source and a ground, or ``what it is in virtue of which one knows or justifiedly believes,'' this article evaluates the basic sources' individual and collective autonomy as well as their vulnerability to defeasibility. It examines the relationship of coherence to knowledge and justification, noting the distinction between a negative dependence on incoherence and a positive dependence on coherence.},

  abstract = {It is regarded as best practice for psychologists to report effect size when disseminating quantitative research findings. Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy -- though this may be changing -- and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.}

  abstract = {The sperm whale communication system, consisting of groups of clicks called codas, has been primarily analyzed in terms of the number of clicks and their inter-click timing. This paper brings a new dimension to the study of sperm whale communication --- spectral properties --- and argues that spectral properties are not an artefact of movement, but likely actively controlled by whales, exchanged in dialogues, and potentially meaningful in this communication system. We discover formant structure in whale codas and uncover previously unobserved spectral patterns that are orthogonal to the traditionally analyzed properties. We present a visualization technique that allows us to describe several previously unobserved patterns. We argue that codas are on many levels analogous to human vowels and diphthongs and can be conceptualized in terms of the source-filter theory: vowel duration and pitch correspond to the number of clicks and their timing (traditional coda types), while spectral properties of clicks correspond to formants in human vowels. We identify two recurrent and discrete coda-level spectral patterns that appear across individual sperm whales and across traditional coda types: the a- and i-coda vowels. We also show that sperm whales have diphthongal patterns on individual codas: rising, falling, rising-falling and falling-rising formant patterns are observed. These uncovered patterns suggest that spectral properties have the potential to add to the communicative complexity of codas independent of the traditionally analyzed properties.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        In previous research, sperm whale             codas             (structured series of clicks used for communication) have been shown to resemble human vowels acoustically. Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described:             a             -codas and             i             -codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ``vowel'' quality (             a             vs.             i             ). Second,             a             -codas are generally longer than             i             -codas. Third, the duration of             i             -codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short             i             -codas and long             {\=i}             -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.                                   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT                            Sperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as               codas               . The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.},

It offers both principles and methods, presenting the conceptual foundations of linguistic data management and a series of case studies, each of which demonstrates a concrete application of abstract principles in a current practice. In part 1, contributors bring together knowledge from information science, archiving, and data stewardship relevant to linguistic data management. Topics covered include implementation principles, archiving data, finding and using datasets, and the valuation of time and effort involved in data management. Part 2 presents snapshots of practices across various subfields, with each chapter presenting a unique data management project with generalizable guidance for researchers. The Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management is an essential addition to the toolkit of every linguist, guiding researchers toward making their data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.}

  abstract = {The tongue often shows some forward movement during the closure phase of velar consonants, resulting in elliptical trajectories (loops) in symmetrical VCV utterances. Several hypotheses exist for the cause of these loops, but none can consistently explain all observations. This study demonstrates that loops also occur in V1-V2-V1 sequences with no consonants involved. It is shown that both the direction of the loops and the relative loop widths vary systematically with the orientation of the main movement line between the vowels V1 and V2. From these observations we argue that different biomechanical properties of the tongue muscles are the main cause for loops. Model simulations support this conclusion.},

The model was applied for the detailed reproduction of movements in repeated consonant--vowel syllables measured by electromagnetic articulography (EMA). The trajectories for the constrictor (lower lip, tongue tip, or tongue dorsum) and the jaw were reproduced. Thereby, we tested the following hypotheses about invariant properties of articulatory commands: 1) The target of the primary articulator for a consonant is invariant with respect to phonetic context, stress, and speaking rate. 2) Vowel targets are invariant with respect to speaking rate and stress. 3) The onsets of articulatory commands for the jaw and the constrictor are synchronized. Our results in terms of high-quality matches between observed and model-generated trajectories support these hypotheses. The findings of this study can be applied to the development of control models for articulatory speech synthesis.},

In this paper, we focus on translating domain expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions over model parameters, a process known as prior elicitation. Expert knowledge can manifest itself in diverse formats, including information about raw data, summary statistics, or model parameters. A major challenge for existing elicitation methods is how to effectively utilize all of these different formats in order to formulate prior distributions that align with the expert's expectations, regardless of the model structure. To address these challenges, we develop a simulation-based elicitation method that can learn the hyperparameters of potentially any parametric prior distribution from a wide spectrum of expert knowledge using stochastic gradient descent. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our elicitation method in four representative simulation studies covering linear models, generalized linear models, and hierarchical models. Our results support the claim that our method is largely independent of the underlying model structure and adaptable to various elicitation techniques, including quantile-based, moment-based, and histogram-based methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Theories of phonology claim variously that phonological elements are either innate or emergent, and either substance-full or substance-free. A hitherto underdeveloped source of evidence for choosing between the four possible combinations of these claims lies in showing precisely how a child can acquire phonological elements. This article presents computer simulations that showcase a learning algorithm with which the learner creates phonological elements from a large number of sound--meaning pairs. In the course of language acquisition, phonological features gradually emerge both bottom-up and top-down, that is, both from the phonetic input (i.e., sound) and from the semantic or morphological input (i.e., structured meaning). In our computer simulations, the child's phonological features end up with emerged               links               to sounds (phonetic substance) as well as with emerged               links               to meanings (semantic substance), without               containing               either phonetic or semantic substance. These simulations therefore show that emergent substance-free phonological features are learnable. In the absence of learning algorithms for linking innate features to the language-specific variable phonetic reality, as well as the absence of learning algorithms for substance-full emergence, these results provide a new type of support for theories of phonology in which features are emergent and substance-free.                        ,              R{\'e}sum{\'e}                            Les th{\'e}ories de la phonologie varient selon qu'elles affirment que les {\'e}l{\'e}ments phonologiques sont inn{\'e}s ou {\'e}mergents, et selon qu'elles affirment que ces {\'e}l{\'e}ments phonologiques sont porteurs ou non de substance.

Au cours de l'acquisition du langage, les traits phonologiques {\'e}mergent progressivement {\`a} la fois de bas en haut et de haut en bas, c'est-{\`a}-dire {\`a} partir de l'entr{\'e}e phon{\'e}tique (c'est-{\`a}-dire le son) et de l'entr{\'e}e s{\'e}mantique ou morphologique (c'est-{\`a}-dire le sens structur{\'e}). Dans nos simulations informatiques, les traits phonologiques de l'enfant finissent par avoir des               liens               {\'e}mergents avec les sons (substance phon{\'e}tique) ainsi que des               liens               {\'e}mergents avec les significations (substance s{\'e}mantique), sans               contenir               ni substance phon{\'e}tique ni substance s{\'e}mantique. Ces simulations montrent donc que les traits phonologiques {\'e}mergents sans substance sont apprenables. En l'absence d'algorithmes d'apprentissage permettant de relier les traits inn{\'e}s {\`a} la r{\'e}alit{\'e} phon{\'e}tique variable en fonction de la langue, ainsi que d'algorithmes d'apprentissage pour l'{\'e}mergence des traits avec substance, ces r{\'e}sultats fournissent un nouveau type de soutien aux th{\'e}ories de la phonologie dans lesquelles les traits sont {\'e}mergents et sans substance.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the various meanings of probability and its different applications, and we focus especially on the classical, the frequentist, and the subjectivist view. We describe the different problems of how probability can be measured in each of the approaches, and how each of them can be well justified by a mathematical theory. We analyse the foundations of probability, where the scientific analysis of the theory that allows for a frequentist interpretation leads to unsolvable problems. Kolmogorov's axiomatic theory does not suffice to establish statistical inference without further definitions and principles. Finally, we show how statistical inference essentially determines the meaning of probability and a shift emerges from purely objectivist views to a complementary conception of probability with frequentist and subjectivist constituents. For didactical purpose, the result of the present analyses explains basic problems of teaching, originating from a biased focus on frequentist aspects of probability. It also indicates a high priority for the design of suitable learning paths to a complementary conception of probability. In the applications, modellers use information in a pragmatic way processing this information regardless of its connotation into formal mathematical models, which are always thought as essentially wrong but useful.},

  abstract = {This study relies on a corpus illustrating several dozen Romance dialects from France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Portugal, for which 145 innovations relative to Latin have been encoded in the form of 1 (presence) or 0 (absence). Based on contemporary recordings (translations of Aesop's 100-word fable ``The North Wind and the Sun'' and another 100-word list), following the principles of dialecto\-metry, the Comparative method and especially historical glottometry, we propose computational tools to address the relationships and classifications amongst these Romance varieties. Results of data-mining techniques confirm the robustness of a North/\hspace{0pt}South divide --- with the O{\"i}l area being, by far, the most innovative --- and, secondarily, an opposition between the South-West (mainly Ibero-Romance) and the South-East (mainly Italo-Romance, more conservative). Among the most important/\hspace{0pt}discriminant features are the palatalisation of Latin ca, which characterises the majority of northern Gallo-Romance dialects, and the simplification of geminates north of the La Spezia-Rimini line. Most innovations relate to phonetic/\hspace{0pt}phono\-logical traits. However, we also consider morphosyntactic and lexical features, such as non-null subject in northern Gallo-Romance varieties, and the substitution of cum `with' by apud {$>$} amb in Occitano-Romance varieties. By retaining only morpho\-syntactic innovations, we still find a North vs. South-East- vs. South-West tripartition.},

First, we review the evidence that future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms---including humanity---is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts. Second, we ask what political or economic system, or leadership, is prepared to handle the predicted disasters, or even capable of such action. Third, this dire situation places an extraordinary responsibility on scientists to speak out candidly and accurately when engaging with government, business, and the public. We especially draw attention to the lack of appreciation of the enormous challenges to creating a sustainable future. The added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends. The science underlying these issues is strong, but awareness is weak. Without fully appreciating and broadcasting the scale of the problems and the enormity of the solutions required, society will fail to achieve even modest sustainability goals.},

  abstract = {One structural dimension that varies across languages is the simultaneous or sequential expression of meaning. Complex predicates can layer meanings together simultaneously in a single-verb predicate (SVP) or distribute them sequentially in a multiple-verb predicate (MVP). We ask whether typological variability in this dimension might be a consequence of systematic patterns of diachronic change. We examine the distribution of markers of agency and number within the verb phrase (the predicate) in the earliest stages of a young, emerging sign language in Nicaragua, Lengua de Se{\~n}as Nicarag{\"u}ense (LSN), beginning with homesign systems like those from which LSN originated, and progressing through two decades of transmission to new learners. We find that: (i) LSN2 signers are more likely to produce MVPs than homesigners or LSN1 signers; (ii) in the MVPs they do produce, homesigners and LSN1 signers are more likely to produce predicates that mark both agency and number simultaneously on at least one of the verbs; LSN2 signers are just as likely to produce sequences with verbs that mark agency and number in sequentially separate verbs. We discuss how language acquisition, modality, and structure, as well as specific social factors associated with each of the groups, play a role in driving these changes, and how, over time, these patterns of change might yield the diversity of forms observed across spoken and signed languages today.},

  abstract = {Paragraph: This study explores how analytical choices of researchers affect the reliability of scientific findings. Current lack-of-reliability discussions focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to include idiosyncratic decisions in data analysis that lead researchers to diverging results and conclusions. We coordinated and observed decisions among 73 research-teams as they independently tested the same hypothesis using the same data. Results show that in this typical secondary data research situation, the universe of pathways from data to results is so vast that each analysis was unique in some way. Teams reported divergent findings with contradictory substantive implications that could not be explained by differences in researchers' expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations. This calls for greater humility and clarity in presentation of scientific findings. Idiosyncratic variation may also be a cause for why many hypotheses remain highly contested, particularly in large-scale social and behavioral research.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical model of the tongue and the oral cavity, controlled by a functional model of muscle force generation ({$\lambda$}-model of the equilibrium point hypothesis) and coupled with an acoustic model, was exploited to study the activation of the tongue and mouth floor muscles during the production of French cardinal vowels. The selection of the motor commands to control the tongue and the mouth floor muscles was based on literature data, such as electromyographic, electropalatographic, and cineradiographic data. The tongue shapes were also compared to data obtained from the speaker used to build the model. 3D modeling offered the opportunity to investigate the role of the transversalis, in particular, its involvement in the production of high front vowels. It was found, with this model, to be indirect via reflex mechanisms due to the activation of surrounding muscles, not voluntary. For vowel /i/, local motor command variations for the main tongue muscles revealed a non-negligible modification of the alveolar groove in contradiction to the saturation effect hypothesis, due to the role of the anterior genioglossus. Finally, the impact of subject position (supine or upright) on the production of French cardinal vowels was explored and found to be negligible.},

The               wave               model describes the radiation of linguistic change outwards from a central focus. Changes can also jump between population centres in a process known as               hierarchical diffusion               . It has recently been proposed that the spatial evolution of dialects can be understood using surface tension at linguistic boundaries. Here we show that the inclusion of long-range interactions in the surface tension model generates both wave-like spread, and hierarchical diffusion, and that it is surface tension that is the dominant effect in deciding the stable distribution of dialect patterns. We generalize the model to allow population mixing which can induce shrinkage of linguistic domains, or destroy dialect regions from within.},

Employing the conceptual orientation of enregisterment, the article theorizes the challenges for decolonizing discourses in negotiating a critical and transformative uptake. It concludes by outlining some strategies that can help in entextualizing translingualism to preserve its decolonizing potential. It identifies areas of research that will expand the communities, contexts, and communication that will facilitate more pluriversal epistemologies and practices.},

It argues that capacity building for both the abled and disabled in the North is implicated in the disablement of people in the Global South. A decolonial orientation to disability studies values vulnerability, relationality, and ethics which are less privileged in the academy. The article demonstrates how such a crip linguistics might facilitate a different understanding of language competence and analysis. Bringing out the ableism in dominant models of language competence, the article illustrates how linguistics might conceive communication as anomalous embodiment. Such an orientation will move from grammatical norms to nonnormativity, and diversity to multiplicity, as speakers engage with social networks and material ecologies for generating meanings in distributed practice motivated by relational ethics.},

Contemplating the diversity of worldviews in the social sciences may be confronting for those of us from a biomedical background who are unfamiliar with the concepts and unused to metaphysical reflection. However, we need to explore the literature and reflect on our own underlying beliefs to maintain the cohesion of our research. Philosophical stance is generally taken to mean ontology and epistemology, or ``what is real'' and ``how we know what we know'', so developing your philosophical stance involves clarifying your beliefs about the nature of reality and knowledge. Our philosophical stance will influence our research design, practice and reporting. If we are unaware or uncertain of our philosophical stance, we risk misalignment, which will detract from our research claims and undermine their impact. Our philosophical stance is, thus, crucial for ourselves and our audience. This article presents a case study of how my philosophical stance developed over my candidature. I share it to provide insights for others contemplating the same journey. In particular, this paper acknowledges and normalises how understanding and articulating that stance evolved over time.},

The data show that the singleton versus geminate contrast is conveyed by specific kinematic properties in addition to systematic durational differences in both the consonantal and vocalic intervals; by contrast, tautosyllabic and heterosyllabic clusters differ significantly for the duration of the consonantal interval but do not vary systematically with respect to the vocalic interval and cannot be consistently differentiated at the kinematic level. We conclude that systematic variations in acoustic vowel duration and the kinematics of tongue tip gestures represent the phonetic correlates of the segmental phonological contrast between short and long consonants, rather than of syllable structure. Data are only partly consistent with the predictions of both moraic and gesture-based models of the syllable about the effects of syllable structure on speech production dynamics and call for a more gradient view of syllabification.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Decolonizing Linguistics, the companion volume to Inclusion in Linguistics, is designed to uncover and intervene in the history and ongoing legacy of colonization and colonial thinking in linguistics and related fields. The volume's introduction theorizes decolonization as a process of centering Black, Native, and Indigenous perspectives, describes the extensive dialogic and collaborative process through which the volume was developed, and then lays out key principles of decolonizing linguistic research and teaching. The 20 chapters cover a wide range of languages and linguistic contexts (e.g., Bantu languages, Creoles, Dominican Spanish, Francophone Africa, Zapotec) as well as various disciplines and subfields (applied linguistics, communication, historical linguistics, language documentation and revitalization/reclamation, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, syntax). Contributors address such topics as being transparent about the political nature of all linguistic research; exposing colonial and racist thought in psycholinguistics; refusing settler-colonial practices and centering community goals in research on Indigenous languages; amplifying the liberatory tradition of Caribbean linguistics; confronting minoritization as a racialized applied linguist in Europe; anti-Blackness in French linguistics; teaching linguistics and communication through a decolonial and antiracist lens; decolonizing research partnerships between the Global South and the Global North; envisioning anticolonial Open Methods in linguistics; decolonizing research on Creoles; prioritizing Black Diasporic perspectives in linguistics; and challenging deficit approaches to linguistic variation in communication curricula. The volume's conclusion lays out specific actions that linguists can take through research, teaching, and institutional structures to refuse coloniality in linguistics and to move the field toward a decolonized future.},

The first-formant amplitude A1 is also reduced relative to its amplitude for an oral vowel. These acoustic characteristics can be explained by speech production theory. The objective of this study was to determine the values for the acoustic correlates A1-P1 and A1-P0 (dB) for quantifying nasalization. They were tested as measures of nasalization by comparing vowels between nasal consonants and those between stop consonants for English speakers. Also, portions of nasal vowels following a stop consonant were compared for speakers of French, which makes a linguistic distinction between oral and nasal vowels. In the analysis of English, the mean difference of A1-P1 measured in oral vowels and nasalized vowels had a range of 10 dB--15 dB; the difference of A1-P0 had a range of 6 dB--8 dB. In the study of French, the difference of A1-P1 measured between the least-nasalized portion and the most-nasalized portion of the vowel had a range of 9 dB--12 dB; for A1-P0, the difference ranged between 3 dB and 9 dB. In order to obtain an absolute acoustic measure of nasalization that was independent of vowel type, normalized parameters were calculated by adjusting for the influence of the vowel formant frequencies.},

Here, radial frequency (RF) patterns were adapted in order to compare the Bouba/Kiki effect in Eastern and Western participants demonstrating different perceptual styles. Three attributes of the RF patterns were manipulated: The frequency, amplitude, and spikiness of the sinusoidal modulations along the circumference of a circle. By testing participants in the US and Taiwan, both cultural commonalities and differences in sound-shape correspondence were revealed. RF patterns were more likely to be matched with ``Kiki'' than with ``Bouba'' when the frequency, amplitude, and spikiness increased. The responses from both groups of participants had a similar weighting on frequency; nevertheless, the North Americans had a higher weighting on amplitude, but a lower weighting on spikiness, than their Taiwanese counterparts. These novel results regarding cultural differences suggest that the Bouba/Kiki effect is partly tuned by differing perceptual experience. In addition, using the RF patterns in the Bouba/Kiki effect provides a ``mid-level'' linkage between visual and auditory processing, and a future understanding of sound-shape correspondences based on the mechanism of visual pattern processing.},

  abstract = {Preregistration is a method to increase research transparency by documenting research decisions on a public, third-party repository prior to any influence by data. It is becoming increasingly popular in all subfields of psychology and beyond. Adherence to the preregistration plan may not always be feasible and even is not necessarily desirable, but without disclosure of deviations, readers who do not carefully consult the preregistration plan might get the incorrect impression that the study was exactly conducted and reported as planned. In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in               Psychological Science               between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

Philosophy was presented with different roles, including that philosophical stance can direct the decision to use mixed methods or result from that choice. This article contributes the field of MMR by highlighting an oversight in the reporting practices of the MMR community. Possible causes for the findings include weaknesses in research education and knowledge.

In particular, we examined the production of the five Spanish phonemic monophthongs (/i e a o u/) in two prosodic positions: stressed and unstressed. Since Spanish and English vary in the nature of the difference between stressed and unstressed vowels, a logical question is: How does the relationship between stressed and unstressed vowels differ across the three groups of participants? Do the learners transfer English patterns to their Spanish? The findings are discussed in terms of their significance for current models of second language speech learning and provide important information regarding the paths of pronunciation development in the second language acquisition of Spanish.},

The colorspace package can produce more colors, but it is not immediately clear how to use it to produce colors that can be reliably distingushed in different kinds of plots. However, applications to genomics would be enhanced by the ability to display at least the 24 human chromosomes in distinct colors, as is common in technologies like spectral karyotyping. In this article, we describe the Polychrome package, which can be used to construct palettes with at least 24 colors that can be distinguished by most people with normal color vision. Polychrome includes a variety of visualization methods allowing users to evaluate the proposed palettes. In addition, we review the history of attempts to construct qualitative color palettes with many colors.},

  abstract = {Phonetic research frequently involves analyzing numeric continuous outcome variables, such as durations, frequencies, loudness, and ratios. Another commonly used outcome type is proportions, including measures like the proportion of voicing during closure, gesture amplitude, and nasalance. Despite their bounded nature, proportions are often modeled using Gaussian regression, largely due to the default settings of commonly used statistical functions in R (e.g., lm() and lmer() from lme4). This practice persists in teaching and research, despite the fact that Gaussian models assume unbounded continuous data and may poorly fit proportion data. To address this issue, this tutorial introduces beta regression models, a more appropriate statistical approach for analyzing proportions. The beta distribution provides a flexible framework for modelling continuous data constrained between 0 and 1. The tutorial employs the brms package in R and assumes familiarity with regression modeling but no prior knowledge of Bayesian statistics. The tutorial includes two case studies illustrating the practical implementation of Bayesian beta regression models. Data and code are available at https://github.com/stefanocoretta/beta-phon.},

This highlights the value placed on conference interactions. Despite the importance of conferences, very little has been studied about what is learned from the presentations and how presenters can effectively achieve their goals. This essay identifies several challenges presenters face when giving conference presentations and discusses how presenters can use the tenets of scientific teaching to meet these challenges. We ask presenters the following questions: How do you engage the audience and promote learning during a presentation? How do you create an environment that is inclusive for all in attendance? How do you gather feedback from the professional community that will help to further advance your research? These questions target three broad goals that stem from the scientific teaching framework and that we propose are of great importance at conferences: learning, equity, and improvement. Using a backward design approach, we discuss how the lens of scientific teaching and the use of specific active-learning strategies can enhance presentations, improve their utility, and ensure that a presentation is broadly accessible to all audience members.},

The field of linguistic typology seeks to answer these questions and, thereby, divine the mechanisms that underlie human language. In our work, we tackle the problem of vowel system typology, i.e., we propose a generative probability model of which vowels a language contains. In contrast to previous work, we work directly with the acoustic information---the first two formant values---rather than modeling discrete sets of phonemic symbols (IPA). We develop a novel generative probability model and report results based on a corpus of 233 languages.},

Such reforms, however, may be hindered by a general lack of understanding of CIs and how to interpret them. In this study, we assessed conceptual knowledge of CIs in undergraduate and graduate psychology students. CIs were difficult and prone to misconceptions for both groups. Connecting CIs to estimation and sample mean concepts was associated with greater conceptual knowledge of CIs. Connecting CIs to null hypothesis significance testing, however, was not associated with conceptual knowledge of CIs. It may therefore be beneficial to focus on estimation and sample mean concepts in instruction about CIs.},

We are building off of our success with that title to address the specific challenges that online instructors face in higher education. Author James Lang is partnering with eLearning expert Flower Darby to write and promote the book. RAPIDLY GROWING SEGMENT OF STUDENT POPULATION: According to the Online Learning Consortium, in 2016, 5.8 million students were enrolled in at least one online course. This represents a 263\% increase over the last decade. Two-thirds of these 5.8 million students take online courses through public institutions. ONLINE LEARNING IS PREFERRED BY TODAY'S LEARNER: The Online Learning Consortium study also shows that 90\% of today's student believes online learning is as good as or better than the traditional classroom experience. INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH EDTECH: A survey of university Chief Information Officers shows that 96\% believe adaptive technology has potential to improve student outcomes, while 87\% believe technology provides a richer experience for students. Students agree, except that 4 out of 5 would also say universities should be doing more with technology-based learning experiences. This book will help higher education instructors do that"--},

An X-ray microbeam data base of 2 speakers of American English reciting monosyllabic words, which differed in their final consonants and in their position in the accentual structure of the utterance, was studied to evaluate these three accounts. In this data base, vowel duration differences due to the voicing of the following consonants were amplified by the presence of accent. Also, many of the duration differences associated with the following consonants are localized in the later portion of the opening movement, suggesting that subjects often create vowel duration changes by initiating the consonant closing gesture at an earlier or later time relative to the opening gesture.}

  abstract = {Significance             Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college STEM instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.           ,              We compared students' self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students' perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students' motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students' response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

However, most methodological reform attempts suffer from similar mistakes and over-generalizations to the ones they aim to address. We argue that this can be attributed in part to lack of formalism and first principles. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for formal statistical rigor and scientific nuance in methodological reform. To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (i) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (ii) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (iii) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of incomplete neutralisation describes a situation where a putative case of categorical phonological neutralisation is observed to be phonetically nonneutralising. This has been argued to be a problem for phonological theories that employ categorical features. Here, we use two distinct feeding orders of tone sandhi processes from Huai'an Mandarin to show that incomplete phonetic neutralisation is compatible with categorical phonological phenomena. Therefore, incomplete phonetic neutralisation does not automatically inform us of gradient phonological representations. We further show that incomplete phonetic neutralisation can in fact have a large effect size. Such results are not surprising from a classic generative view of phonology where linguistic performance is argued to be a multifactorial problem, and linguistic knowledge (i.e., competence) is only one of the many factors involved. Furthermore, our results suggest that the observed incompleteness or gradience may have a source outside phonological knowledge.},

The BiLSTM-based model is trained as a phoneme classifier and takes a sequence of real articulatory trajectories as input and returns the probability of phonemes over time. The optimization minimizes a cost function which is the weighted sum of the conflicting demands of being intelligible and least articulatory effort. The data-driven intelligibility model presented in this paper is used to compute the intelligibility score. Simulations support Lindblom's hypo- and hyper-articulation theory of speech, as the degree of hyper-articulation of speech can be modified and tuned along a continuum by balancing the importance given to both requirements of intelligibility and least articulatory effort.},

We highlight cross-linguistic variation, introduce measuring techniques, and discuss the relationship between phonation and other phonological dimensions (e.g., tone, vowel quality). We also review perceptual literature, an area of phonation research that has greatly expanded recently. Taken together, the studies reviewed demonstrate that phonation types indeed lie not just on a single continuum, but in a multidimensional space.},

Almost half of the articles (49\%) that used null-hypothesis significance testing contained at least one inconsistent p-value. Around one in eight articles (12\%) contained an inconsistency that may have affected the statistical conclusion. The inconsistency rates were comparable across journals and seem stable over publication years. We discuss possible reasons for this high rate and offer actionable steps for authors, reviewers, and editors to remedy this state of affairs.},

  abstract = {A minimal constructed language (conlang) is useful for experiments and comfortable for making tools. The Toki Pona (TP) conlang is minimal both in the vocabulary (with only 14 letters and 124 lemmas) and in the (about) 10 syntax rules. The language is useful for being a used and somewhat established minimal conlang with at least hundreds of fluent speakers. This article exposes current concepts and resources for TP, and makes available Python (and Vim) scripted routines for the analysis of the language, synthesis of texts, syntax highlighting schemes, and the achievement of a preliminary TP Wordnet. Focus is on the analysis of the basic vocabulary, as corpus analyses were found. The synthesis is based on sentence templates, relates to context by keeping track of used words, and renders larger texts by using a fixed number of phonemes (e.g. for poems) and number of sentences, words and letters (e.g. for paragraphs). Syntax highlighting reflects morphosyntactic classes given in the official dictionary and different solutions are described and implemented in the well-established Vim text editor. The tentative TP Wordnet is made available in three patterns of relations between synsets and word lemmas. In summary, this text holds potentially novel conceptualizations about, and tools and results in analyzing, synthesizing and syntax highlighting the TP language.},

We probed for multiple bias-related patterns in a large random sample of meta-analyses taken from all disciplines. The magnitude of these biases varied widely across fields and was on average relatively small. However, we consistently observed that small, early, highly cited studies published in peer-reviewed journals were likely to overestimate effects. We found little evidence that these biases were related to scientific productivity, and we found no difference between biases in male and female researchers. However, a scientist's early-career status, isolation, and lack of scientific integrity might be significant risk factors for producing unreliable results.           ,              Numerous biases are believed to affect the scientific literature, but their actual prevalence across disciplines is unknown. To gain a comprehensive picture of the potential imprint of bias in science, we probed for the most commonly postulated bias-related patterns and risk factors, in a large random sample of meta-analyses taken from all disciplines. The magnitude of these biases varied widely across fields and was overall relatively small. However, we consistently observed a significant risk of small, early, and highly cited studies to overestimate effects and of studies not published in peer-reviewed journals to underestimate them. We also found at least partial confirmation of previous evidence suggesting that US studies and early studies might report more extreme effects, although these effects were smaller and more heterogeneously distributed across meta-analyses and disciplines. Authors publishing at high rates and receiving many citations were, overall, not at greater risk of bias. However, effect sizes were likely to be overestimated by early-career researchers, those working in small or long-distance collaborations, and those responsible for scientific misconduct, supporting hypotheses that connect bias to situational factors, lack of mutual control, and individual integrity. Some of these patterns and risk factors might have modestly increased in intensity over time, particularly in the social sciences. Our findings suggest that, besides one being routinely cautious that published small, highly-cited, and earlier studies may yield inflated results, the feasibility and costs of interventions to attenuate biases in the literature might need to be discussed on a discipline-specific and topic-specific basis.},

We claim that none of the current models provides a satisfactory account of the grammaticalization phenomenon, a linguistic process by which words acquire a grammatical status. We argue that this limitation is mainly due to the way these models represent language and communication mechanisms. We therefore introduce a new framework, the ``grammatheme,'' as a tool which formalizes in an unambiguous way different concepts and mechanisms involved in grammaticalization. The model especially includes an inference mechanism triggering new grammaticalization processes. We present promising preliminary results of a numerical implementation and discuss a possible research program based on this framework.},

  abstract = {Progress in psychology has been frustrated by challenges concerning replicability, generalizability, strategy selection, inferential reproducibility, and computational reproducibility. Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and non-intellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo Principal Investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big team science. We also anticipate that big team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big team science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big team science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles, raising risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond.},

However, there is scant knowledge of how manuscripts change throughout the review process in academic journals. Here, we examined 27 467 manuscripts submitted to four journals from the Royal Society (2006--2017) and analysed the effect of peer review on the amount of statistical content of manuscripts, i.e. one of the most important aspects to assess the methodological rigour of manuscripts. We found that manuscripts with both initial low or high levels of statistical content increased their statistical content during peer review. The availability of guidelines on statistics in the review forms of journals was associated with an initial similarity of statistical content of manuscripts but did not have any relevant implications on manuscript change during peer review. We found that when reports were more concentrated on statistical content, there was a higher probability that these manuscripts were eventually rejected by editors.},

This is paradoxical in view of the importance of data for phonetic research: from audio signals to the whole range of data acquired in phonetic experiments. The phonetic sciences stand to gain greatly from data availability: what is at stake is no less than reproducibility and cumulative progress. We will argue that a collective turn to Open Science holds great promise for phonetics. First, simple reflections on why access to primary data matters are recapitulated and proposed as a basis for consensus. Next, possible drawbacks of data availability are addressed. Finally, we argue that data curation and archiving are to be recognized as part of the same activity that results in the publication of research papers, rather than attempting to build a parallel system to incentivize data archiving by itself.},

Here we explore a more active role of stories in social science research, not merely to illustrate concepts but also to develop new ideas and evaluate hypotheses, for example, in deciding that a research method is effective. We see stories as central to engagement with the development and evaluation of theories, and we argue that for a story to be useful in this way, it should be anomalous (representing aspects of life that are not well explained by existing models) and immutable (with details that are well-enough established that they have the potential to indicate problems with a new model). We develop these ideas through considering two well-known examples from the work of Karl Weick and Robert Axelrod, and we discuss why transparent sourcing (in the case of Axelrod) makes a story a more effective research tool, whereas improper sourcing (in the case of Weick) interferes with the key useful roles of stories in the scientific process.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Vibrant reform and meta-science movements have emerged. These are exciting developments, and may point towards practical improvements in the future. Yet there is nothing so practical as good theory. This paper outlines aspects of reform and meta-science that appear ripe for an injection of theory, including a lot of excellent and overlooked theoretical work from different disciplines. I focus on theories of meta-science and scientific forensics, theories of scientific aspiration, and theories of cultural change in science. There is much room for theoretical growth -- a growth that can only benefit emerging movements -- and highlight some, focusing especially on the potential of cultural evolutionary theories to help direct reform efforts. We have unwittingly evolved a toxic scientific ecosystem; theory may help us intelligently design a better one.},

We describe a method to convert a virtual human avatar (animated through key frames and interpolation) into a more naturalistic talking head. Speech-capabilities were added to the avatar using real speech production data. Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) data provided lip, jaw and tongue trajectories of a speaker involved in face to face communication. An articulatory model driving jaw, lip and tongue movements was built. Constraining the key frame values, a corresponding high definition tongue articulatory model was developed. The resulting avatar was able to produce visible and partly occluded facial speech movements coherent and synchronous with the acoustic signal.},

  abstract = {Significance             The number of color terms varies drastically across languages. Yet despite these differences, certain terms (e.g., red) are prevalent, which has been attributed to perceptual salience. This work provides evidence for an alternative hypothesis: The use of color terms depends on communicative needs. Across languages, from the hunter-gatherer Tsimane' people of the Amazon to students in Boston, warm colors are communicated more efficiently than cool colors. This cross-linguistic pattern reflects the color statistics of the world: Objects (what we talk about) are typically warm-colored, and backgrounds are cool-colored. Communicative needs also explain why the number of color terms varies across languages: Cultures vary in how useful color is. Industrialization, which creates objects distinguishable solely based on color, increases color usefulness.           ,              What determines how languages categorize colors? We analyzed results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about. We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color usefulness.},

Studies have found that lexical competition (e.g., having a minimal pair competitor, having more phonological neighbors) causes contrastive hyperarticulation of the initial stop voicing contrast in English: greater competition makes VOT longer for voiceless stops and/or shorter for voiced stops (Baese-Berk \& Goldrick 2009, Nelson \& Wedel 2017). I conducted a corpus study that looked for contrastive hyperarticulation of the final stop voicing contrast in English. The cue examined was preceding vowel duration. I did not find contrastive hyperarticulation: neither minimal pair competitor existence nor higher neighborhood density caused vowels to be longer before final [d] or shorter before final [t]. Instead, both competition metrics correlated with shorter vowel durations before [t] and [d]. This result is consistent with Goldrick et al. (2013)'s failure to find contrastive hyperarticulation of the final stop voicing contrast and their hypothesis that competition affects initial and final contrasts differently. It is also consistent with Gahl et al's (2012) finding that high neighborhood density causes reduction.}

The method identifies individual and common patterns of spatial clustering in a set of linguistic variables measured over a set of locations based on a combination of three statistical techniques: spatial autocorrelation, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. To demonstrate how to apply this method, it is used to analyze regional variation in the values of 40 continuously measured, high-frequency lexical alternation variables in a 26-million-word corpus of letters to the editor representing 206 cities from across the United States.},

This means that either all the theories are correct, or the literature is biased towards positive findings. Results from large-scale replication projects and the prevalence of questionable research practices indicate the latter. This is a problem because science progresses from being wrong. For decades, there have been calls for better theories and the adoption of a strong inference approach to science. However, there is little reason to believe that psychological science is ready to change. Although recent developments like the open science movement have improved transparency and replicability, they have not addressed psychological science's method-oriented (rather than problem-oriented) mindset. Psychological science still does not embrace the scientific method of developing theories, conducting critical tests of those theories, detecting contradictory results, and revising (or disposing of) the theories accordingly. In this article, I review why psychologists must embrace being wrong and how the Registered Report format might be one strategy for stopping psychology's winning streak.},

It is based on a subdivision of language processing into three components: Memory, Unification, and Control. The functional components as well as the neurobiological underpinnings of the model are discussed. In addition, the need for extension of the model beyond the classical core regions for language is shown. The attention network and the network for inferential processing are crucial to realize language comprehension beyond single word processing and beyond decoding propositional content. It is shown that this requires the dynamic interaction between multiple brain regions.},

  abstract = {As part of a larger study of the effect of prosody on segmental cues, previous work has shown that in a high pitch environment, F0 is significantly increased relative to a baseline following voiceless obstruents, but F0 closely follows the baseline following voiced obstruents. When a syllable carries a low or no pitch accent, F0 is increased only slightly following all obstruents. It is suggested that this difference occurs because demands of the segmental and prosodic levels of speech production conflict. In particular, results support a theory that the primary feature of voiced or voiceless obstruents is [.-stiff] or [+stiff] vocal folds, respectively. Enhancing features such as [-.spread] or [+spread] vocal folds are secondary. In a high pitch environment, the feature [-.stiff] conflicts with the need to raise pitch. Because of enhancing gestures, the prosodic level can override the segmental. Likewise, in a low pitch environment, the feature [+stiff] conflicts, so the vocal folds will not be stiffened for voiceless obstruents. If so, one might expect that stop consonants in low pitch environments will have longer or stronger prevoicing than in high pitch environments, and preliminary data show that speakers do show this tendency.

When science is applied to practical decisions, non-epistemic values cannot be excluded. Instead, they have to be combined with (value-deprived) scientific information in a way that leads to practically optimal decisions. A normative model is proposed for the processing of information in both pure and applied science. A general-purpose corpus of scientific knowledge, with high entry requirements, has a central role in this model. Due to its high entry requirements, the information that it contains is sufficiently reliable for the vast majority of practical purposes. However, for some purposes, the corpus needs to be supplemented with additional information, such as scientific indications of danger that do not satisfy the entry requirements for the corpus. The role of non-epistemic values in the evaluation of scientific information should, as far as possible, be limited to determining the level of evidence required for various types of practical decisions.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of scientific articles published to-date have not been accompanied by concomitant publication of the underlying research data upon which they are based. This state of affairs precludes the routine re-use and re-analysis of research data, undermining the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and compromising the credibility of claims that cannot be independently verified. It may be especially important to make data available for the most influential studies that have provided a foundation for subsequent research and theory development. Therefore, we launched an initiative---the Data Ark---to examine whether we could retrospectively enhance the preservation and accessibility of important scientific data. Here we report the outcome of our efforts to retrieve, preserve, and liberate data from 111 of the most highly-cited articles published in psychology and psychiatry between 2006--2011 (n = 48) and 2014--2016 (n = 63). Most data sets were not made available (76/111, 68\%, 95\% CI [60, 77]), some were only made available with restrictions (20/111, 18\%, 95\% CI [10, 27]), and few were made available in a completely unrestricted form (15/111, 14\%, 95\% CI [5, 22]). Where extant data sharing systems were in place, they usually (17/22, 77\%, 95\% CI [54, 91]) did not allow unrestricted access. Authors reported several barriers to data sharing, including issues related to data ownership and ethical concerns. The Data Ark initiative could help preserve and liberate important scientific data, surface barriers to data sharing, and advance community discussions on data stewardship.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {The threat to reproducibility and awareness of current rates of research misbehavior sparked initiatives to better academic science. One initiative is preregistration of quantitative research. We investigate whether the preregistration format could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative research, data are used to decide which way interpretation should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be tracked using preregistration, and that preregistration would provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualize preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit. Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivize qualitative researchers to report constantly on their study's development. We conclude with suggested modifications to the Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for qualitative studies.},

  abstract = {The origins of the Indo-European language family are hotly disputed.~Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of core~vocabulary have~produced~conflicting results,~with some supporting a farming~expansion out of Anatolia {\textasciitilde}9000~years before present (yr B.P.),~while others support a spread with~horse-based pastoralism out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe {\textasciitilde}6000~yr B.P.~Here we present an extensive database of Indo-European core vocabulary that eliminates past inconsistencies in cognate coding. Ancestry-enabled phylogenetic analysis of this dataset indicates that few ancient languages are direct ancestors of modern clades and produces a root age of {\textasciitilde}8120 yr B.P. for the family. Although this date is not consistent with the Steppe hypothesis, it does not rule out an initial homeland south of the Caucasus, with a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe and then across Europe. We reconcile this hybrid hypothesis with recently published ancient~DNA~evidence from the steppe and the northern Fertile Crescent.~           ,              Editor's summary                            Languages of the Indo-European family are spoken by almost half of the world's population, but their origins and patterns of spread are disputed. Heggarty               et al               . present a database of 109 modern and 52 time-calibrated historical Indo-European languages, which they analyzed with models of Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Their results suggest an emergence of Indo-European languages around 8000 years before present. This is a deeper root date than previously thought, and it fits with an initial origin south of the Caucasus followed by a branch northward into the Steppe region. These findings lead to a ``hybrid hypothesis'' that reconciles current linguistic and ancient DNA evidence from both the eastern Fertile Crescent (as a primary source) and the steppe (as a secondary homeland). ---SNV                        ,              Indo-European languages emerged south of the Caucasus around 8300 years ago, followed by an expansion northward to the Steppe regions.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Almost half the world's population speaks a language of the Indo-European language family. It remains unclear, however, where this family's common ancestral language (Proto-Indo-European) was initially spoken and when and why it spread through Eurasia. The ``Steppe'' hypothesis posits an expansion out of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, no earlier than 6500 years before present (yr B.P.), and mostly with horse-based pastoralism from {\textasciitilde}5000 yr B.P. An alternative ``Anatolian'' or ``farming'' hypothesis posits that Indo-European dispersed with agriculture out of parts of the Fertile Crescent, beginning as early as {\textasciitilde}9500 to 8500 yr B.P. Ancient DNA (aDNA) is now bringing valuable new perspectives, but these remain only indirect interpretations of language prehistory. In this study, we tested between the time-depth predictions of the Anatolian and Steppe hypotheses, directly from language data. We report a new framework for the chronology and divergence sequence of Indo-European, using Bayesian phylogenetic methods applied to an extensive new dataset of core vocabulary across 161 Indo-European languages.                                         RATIONALE               Previous phylolinguistic analyses have produced conflicting results. We diagnosed and resolved the causes of this discrepancy, two in particular. First, the datasets used had limited language sampling and widespread coding inconsistency. Second, some analyses enforced the assumption that modern spoken languages derive directly from ancient written languages rather than from parallel spoken varieties. Together, these methodological problems distorted branch-length estimates and date inferences. We present a new dataset of cognacy (shared word origins) across Indo-European. This dataset eliminates past inconsistencies and provides a fuller and more balanced language sample, including 52 nonmodern languages for a denser set of time-calibration points. We applied ancestry-enabled Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to test rather than enforce direct ancestry assumptions.                                         RESULTS               Few ancient written languages are returned as direct ancestors of modern clades. We find a median root age for Indo-European of {\textasciitilde}8120 yr B.P. (95\% highest posterior density: 6740 to 9610 yr B.P.). Our chronology is robust across a range of alternative phylogenetic models and sensitivity analyses that vary data subsets and other parameters. Indo-European had already diverged rapidly into multiple major branches by {\textasciitilde}7000 yr B.P., without a coherent non-Anatolian core. Indo-Iranic has no close relationship with Balto-Slavic, weakening the case for it having spread via the steppe.                                         CONCLUSION               Our results are not entirely consistent with either the Steppe hypothesis or the farming hypothesis. Recent aDNA evidence suggests that the Anatolian branch cannot be sourced to the steppe but rather to south of the Caucasus. For other branches, potential candidate expansion(s) out of the Yamnaya culture are detectable in aDNA, but some had only limited genetic impact. Our results reveal that these expansions from {\textasciitilde}5000 yr B.P. onward also came too late for the language chronology of Indo-European divergence. They are consistent, however, with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a subsequent branch northward onto the steppe, as a secondary homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe with the later Corded Ware--associated expansions. Language phylogenetics and aDNA thus combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and Steppe hypotheses.

Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species -- frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior -- hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Could we ever understand them, and indeed learn to communicate with them? This highly original, thought-provoking book takes us on a fascinating journey over billions of years, from the formation of galaxies and solar systems, to the appearance of planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars, and then to how biology and, ultimately, human life arose on our own planet. It delves into how our brains and our language developed, in order to explore the likelihood of communication beyond Earth and whether it would evolve along similar lines. In the process, fascinating insights from the fields of astronomy, evolutionary biology, palaeoanthropology, neuroscience and linguistics are uncovered, shedding new light on life as we know it on Earth, and beyond.},

  abstract = {Investigations of iconicity in language, whereby interactants coordinate meaningful bodily actions to create resemblances, are prevalent across the human communication sciences. However, when it comes to analysing and comparing iconicity across different interactions (e.g., deaf, deafblind, hearing) and modes of communication (e.g., manual signs, speech, writing), it is not always clear we are looking at the same thing. For example, tokens of spoken ideophones and manual depicting actions may both be analysed as iconic forms. Yet spoken ideophones may signal depictive and descriptive qualities via speech, while manual actions may signal depictive, descriptive, and indexical qualities via the shape, movement, and placement of the hands in space. Furthermore, each may co-occur with other semiotics articulated with the face, hands, and body within composite utterances. The paradigm of iconicity as a single property is too broad and coarse for comparative semiotics, as important details necessary for understanding the range of human communicative potentialities may be masked. Here, we draw on semiotic approaches to language and communication, including the model of language as signalled via describing, indicating and/or depicting and the notion of non-referential indexicality, to illustrate the multidimensionality of iconicity in co-present interactions. This builds on our earlier proposal for analysing how different methods of semiotic signalling are combined in multimodal language use. We discuss some implications for the language and communication sciences and explain how this approach may inform a theory of biosemiotics.},

  abstract = {In an effort to understand some of the functional determinants of naming, Koehler's maluma-takete demonstration was examined in two studies, to see whether the matching of the nonsense words and nonsense figures could be accounted for on the basis of physiognomic similarity, as measured by the semantic differential. Matching was found to occur overwhelmingly in the expected direction, and the similarity of semantic differential locations of matched pairs was far greater than that of non-matched pairs. This held strikingly for ``literal'' scales (such as ``Angular-Rounded'') but also held to a lesser extent for clearly ``non-literal'' scales (such as ``Fresh-Stale''), indicating that physiognomic properties over and beyond simple literal description of the stimuli were involved. Study of the semantic differential locations of letters composing the nonsense words, and of ratings of the ``fittingness'' of the letters as names for the nonsense figures, showed that the physiognomic similarity presumably mediating the naming phenomenon may, at least in the Koehler demonstration, reside in the individual letters rather than in some emergent quality of the whole word. All in all, the study attempted to go beyond just checking whether a ``fittingness'' phenomenon occurs in naming, by exploring processes hypothesized to underlie the ``fittingness.'' In at least some cases, physiognomic similarity may be the psychological process mediating naming.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a dialectometric analysis of Scottish Gaelic morphology, with a focus on the noun phrase, using previously unpublished data from the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. Fifty-five morphological features were extracted across 201 survey points, and the data subjected to a variety of analyses, including cluster analysis, regression, and correlation analysis. We establish that the Gaelic noun system shows robust diatopic (i.e. geographical) variation; this challenges previous assertions in the literature, which describe Gaelic morphosyntax as geographically uniform. In addition, we argue that our dialectometric results provide an insight into the grammatical structure of the language that is not easily achievable through the analysis of individual varieties. In particular, we argue that the results highlight a dissociation between morphological categories such as case and gender and their morphophonological exponents, which are particularly complex in Scottish Gaelic. The paper thus serves as a proof of concept for the use of dialectometric findings in a theoretical context.},

  abstract = {Background: Missing data may seriously compromise inferences from randomised clinical trials, especially if missing data are not handled appropriately. The potential bias due to missing data depends on the mechanism causing the data to be missing, and the analytical methods applied to amend the missingness. Therefore, the analysis of trial data with missing values requires careful planning and attention. Methods: The authors had several meetings and discussions considering optimal ways of handling missing data to minimise the bias potential. We also searched PubMed (key words: missing data; randomi*; statistical analysis) and reference lists of known studies for papers (theoretical papers; empirical studies; simulation studies; etc.) on how to deal with missing data when analysing randomised clinical trials. Results: Handling missing data is an important, yet difficult and complex task when analysing results of randomised clinical trials. We consider how to optimise the handling of missing data during the planning stage of a randomised clinical trial and recommend analytical approaches which may prevent bias caused by unavoidable missing data. We consider the strengths and limitations of using of best-worst and worst-best sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. We also present practical flowcharts on how to deal with missing data and an overview of the steps that always need to be considered during the analysis stage of a trial. Conclusions: We present a practical guide and flowcharts describing when and how multiple imputation should be used to handle missing data in randomised clinical.},

  abstract = {This is the first full-scale discussion of English phonology since Chomsky and Halle's seminal The Sound Pattern of English (SPE). The book enphasizes the analysis using ordered rules and builds on SPE by incorporating lexical and metrical and prosodic analysis and the insights afforded by Lexical Phonology. It provides clear explanations and logical development throughout, introducing rules individually and then illustrating their interactions. These features make this influential theory accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds in linguistics and phonology. Rule-ordering diagrams summarize the crucial ordering of approximately 85 rules. Many of the interactions result in phonological opacity, where either the effect of a rule is not evident in the output or its conditions of application are not present in the output, due to the operation of later rules. This demonstrates the superiority of a rule-based account over output oriented approaches such as Optimality Theory or pre-Generative structuralist phonology.},

The bases for evaluating evidence are likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios, computed under a variety of assumptions regarding the alternative hypotheses in null hypothesis significance tests. Likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios provide a useful measure of the evidence in favor of competing hypotheses because they can be interpreted as representing the ratio of the probabilities that each hypothesis assigns to observed data. When they are either very large or very small, they suggest that one hypothesis is much better than the other in predicting observed data. If they are close to 1.0, then both hypotheses provide approximately equally valid explanations for observed data. I find that p-values that are close to 0.05 (i.e., that are ``marginally significant'') correspond to integrated likelihood ratios that are bounded by approximately 7 in two-sided tests, and by approximately 4 in one-sided tests.},

In this paper, we present Phonotacticon 1.0, which contains the phonotactic profiles of 516 Eurasian lects retrieved from descriptive literature. The later versions of Phonotacticon will extend beyond Eurasia and will ultimately cover spoken lects in all macroareas. As an example of the research potential of this database in future studies, we have generated from Phonotacticon several descriptive visualizations, such as the distribution of the maximal onset length, to demonstrate the visually discernible areal distribution of certain phonotactic patterns.},

The results showed that within-category variation was indeed encoded in memory and could have demonstrable effects on priming. However, there were also robust effects of prototypical representations on priming. Encoding of within-category variation was also affected by the presence of lexical counterparts and by the frequency of counterparts.},

Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leave a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.},

  abstract = {Adopting newly proposed `open science' reforms to improve transparency and increase rigor is hard and can make us, as researchers, feel vulnerable. Nonetheless, these reforms are vital to improving the overall quality and confidence of our collective research. We have, through our own experiences, found that preregistration and detailed analysis plans can help to identify, and potentially avoid, errors. Prepublication has similarly helped us to collaborate and receive feedback on manuscripts, particularly during prolonged periods of peer-review. The Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) field is constituted by a diversity of scholars and disciplines, and thus faces somewhat unique challenges in its efforts to establish common practices, standards, and research terminology. In this paper we offer an introduction to the open science reforms of preregistration and prepublication specifically orientated towards the CSR field. We discuss common concerns around these practices, highlighting areas of misunderstanding while conceding and discussing genuine limitations. We conclude with voluntary, low-investment recommendations for best-practices with regards preregistration and preprints for the field of the Cognitive Science of Religion.},

  abstract = {Previous experimental studies showed that in Japanese, vowels are longer after shorter onset consonants; there is durational compensation within a CV-mora. In order to address whether this compensation occurs in natural speech, this study re-examines this observation using the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese. The results, which are based on more than 200 000 CV-mora tokens, show that there is a negative correlation between the onset consonant and the following vowel in terms of their duration. The statistical significance of this negative correlation is assessed by a traditional correlation analysis as well as a bootstrap resampling analysis, which both show that it is unlikely that the observed compensation effect occurred by chance. The compensation is not perfect, however, suggesting that it is a stochastic tendency rather than an absolute principle. This paper closes with a discussion of potential factors that may interact with the durational compensation effect.},

  abstract = {Major changes: The geom\_slabinterval() and geom\_dotsinterval() families gain "sub-guides", which can be passed to the subguide parameter to create axis annotations for the thickness aesthetic (for slabs) and the dot count (for dots) (\#183). The weight aesthetic is now supported in stat\_slabinterval(), including weighted calculations for densities, CDFs, all interval types (quantile intervals, highest density intervals, and highest density continuous intervals), and all point summaries (mean, median, and mode) (\#41). This includes support for the upcoming weighted random variable type in the posterior package. Blurry dotplots are now supported using geom\_blur\_dots(), which accepts an sd aesthetic to set the standard deviation of the blur on each dot. Intervals can also be used in place of blur by passing blur = "interval". This geom is used by the new stat\_mcse\_dots() to show quantiles along with their error using blur (\#63). The new breaks\_quantiles() histogram breaks function allows the construction of quantile histograms with density\_histogram(), stat\_histinterval(), etc. The color ramp scales (e.g. scale\_colour\_ramp\_continuous(), ...) now use an explicit data type, partial\_colour\_ramp(), to encode color ramps and their origin colors, and provide the ramp\_colours() function for applying colour ramps. This should make it easier to pass explicit color ramps without using scale functions, and for packages building on \{ggdist\} to use the colour ramp scales (\#209). Minor changes: The default histogram bin selection algorithm is now "Scott" instead of "Sturges", as "Sturges" tends to be too conservative (\#214). The at parameter to stat\_spike() (or its names) now determines values of an at computed variable, which can be mapped onto aesthetics via after\_stat() to more easily label spikes. (\#203; thanks @mattansb for the suggestion). The arrow parameter is now supported for intervals in geom\_slabinterval() (\#206; thanks to @ASKurz for the suggestion). The default value of overflow in geom\_dotsinterval() is now the new "warn" mode, which works the same as "keep" except that it warns users if the dots will overflow the geometry bounds and suggests solutions (\#213). Optional arguments to automatically partially-applied functions can now be passed a waiver() to use their default value (see auto\_partial()). Several dependency reductions: removed \{cowplot\}, \{purrr\}, \{forcats\}, \{palmerpenguins\}, and \{modelr\} from Suggests; moved \{tidyselect\} and \{dplyr\} from Imports to Suggests. The latter two are only strictly necessary for curve\_interval() due to its use of grouped data frames and tidy selection to specify which columns are conditional and which are joint (the use of grouped data frames with point\_interval() is less strictly necessary, and not used by stats, so is easier to avoid as an absolute dependency). Documentation: The pkgdown documentation now includes an online article on the thickness aesthetic with comprehensive examples of how slab scaling works (\#205). Bug fixes: Ensure Mode() works on analytical constant distributions. Various fixes to ensure compatibility with \{ggplot2\} 3.5.0.},

  abstract = {Abstract             General principles of human cognition can help to explain why languages are more likely to have certain characteristics than others: structures that are difficult to process or produce will tend to be lost over time. One aspect of cognition that is implicated in language use is working memory---the component of short-term memory used for temporary storage and manipulation of information. In this study, we consider the relationship between working memory and regularization of linguistic variation. Regularization is a well-documented process whereby languages become less variable (on some dimension) over time. This process has been argued to be driven by the behavior of individual language users, but the specific mechanism is not agreed upon. Here, we use an artificial language learning experiment to investigate whether limitations in working memory during either language learning or language production drive regularization behavior. We find that taxing working memory during production results in the loss of all types of variation, but the process by which random variation becomes more predictable is better explained by learning biases. A computational model offers a potential explanation for the production effect using a simple self-priming~mechanism.},

  abstract = {The conjugate binomial and Poisson models are commonly used for estimating proportions or rates. However, it is not well known that the conventional noninformative conjugate priors tend to shrink the posterior quantiles toward the boundary or toward the middle of the parameter space, making them thus appear excessively informative. The shrinkage is always largest when the number of observed events is small. This behavior persists for all sample sizes and exposures. The effect of the prior is therefore most conspicuous and potentially controversial when analyzing rare events. As alternative default conjugate priors, I introduce Beta(1/3, 1/3) and Gamma(1/3, 0), which I call `neutral' priors because they lead to posterior distributions with approximately 50 per cent probability that the true value is either smaller or larger than the maximum likelihood estimate. This holds for all sample sizes and exposures as long as the point estimate is not at the boundary of the parameter space. I also discuss the construction of informative prior distributions. Under the suggested formulation, the posterior median coincides approximately with the weighted average of the prior median and the sample mean, yielding priors that perform more intuitively than those obtained by matching moments and quantiles.},

However, the bulk of earier research supporting their perceptual importance has been conducted primarily with synthetic speech stimuli. The present study examined the acoustic correlates of place of articulation in the voiced formant transitions from natural speech. Linear prediction analysis was used to provide detailed temporal and spectral measurements of the formant transitions for /b,d,g/ paired with eight vowels produced by one talker. Measurements of the transition onset and steady-state frequencies, durations, and derived formant loci for F1, F2, and F3 are reported. Analysis of these measures showed little evidence of context invariant acoustic correlates of place. When vowel context was known, most transition parameters were not reliable acoustic correlates of place except for the F2 transition and a two-dimensional representation of F2{\texttimes}F3 onset frequencies. The results indicated that the information contained in the formant transitions in these natural stop-vowel syllables was not sufficient to distinguish place across all the vowel contexts studied.},

In this work, we present a novel and efficient method for parametric representation and compression of motion signal for skeletal animation. The method exploits the temporal coherence of motion signal using quadratic B{\'e}zier curve (QBC) fitting. The method treats the rotational and translation variations of a joint in a sequence of frames as input points in N-dimensional Euclidean space. The input points are parameterized and approximated using QBC least square fitting. Break and fit criterion is used to minimize the number of curve segments required to fit the data. Precise control of fitting accuracy is achieved by user specified tolerance of error limit. We compared the performance of the proposed method with principal component analysis and wavelet transform based methods of MoCap signal compression. The method leads to smaller storage and better visual quality compared to other methods. The low degree of QBC ensures computationally efficient fitting algorithm, especially for the real-time applications.},

  abstract = {Across many years of teaching Research Methods and assessing many applications for admission into higher degree studies which require an understanding of theories, principles, strategies and skills needed to complete a higher degree such as a Masters or a PhD, one of the things I have found problematic for many students is the inability to articulate differences between theory, theoretical framework and a conceptual framework for a proposed research project. This paper uses experiential methodology to draw upon my experience in practice, and systematic literature review methodology to draw upon supporting scholarly literature by leaders in the field, to contribute to existing knowledge on the meaning of each of these concepts, and more importantly to distinguish between them in a study of Research Methods, and in particular as they relate to designing a research proposal and a thesis for a higher degree. The primary aim is to help the reader develop a firm grasp of the meaning of these concepts and how they should be used in academic research discourses. The review answers five questions. 1. What does each of these terms mean? 2. When and how should each be used? 3. What purposes does a theoretical framework serve? 4. How do you develop a theoretical framework for your research proposal or thesis? 5. What does a good theoretical framework look like?}

  abstract = {Several films, including Three Identical Strangers, examined ethical problems in an experiment that involved identical siblings who were adopted as infants and separated into different families to examine the effects of nature versus nurture. The study was primarily designed and directed by Dr Peter Neubauer. The experiment, conducted in the 1960's through 1980's, serves as an important cautionary case study, raising several critical and ongoing ethical issues faced by researchers, universities and archives today. The organisation coordinating the study donated the research records to Yale University under the condition that they remain sealed until 2065, and has impeded study participants' full access to research material. This case raises questions of what investigators, their descendants, research ethics committees or institutional review boards (IRBs), universities and archives should do with study records when researchers retire or die---whether universities should accept researchers' donations of archival records that may contain patient or participant data, and if so, under what conditions. This study also poses crucial issues for IRBs---for example, whether researchers themselves or their designates should control all access to study records, particularly if controversy or lawsuits ensue. These questions will become increasingly crucial since the amount of research has burgeoned over recent decades, and investigators, on retirement or death, may want to donate their archives to universities. This experiment thus highlights ethical questions to which researchers, IRBs, universities, healthcare institutions, archivists and libraries should attend.},

Characteristics of the different distributional regression approaches will be provided to establish a structured overview on the similarities and differences with respect to the required assumptions on the conditional response distribution, theoretical properties, and the availability of software implementations. In addition, challenges arising in the interpretability of distributional regression models will be discussed and all four approaches will be illustrated with an application analyzing determinants of income distributions from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP).},

  abstract = {We introduce the XBX regression model, a continuous mixture of extended-support beta regressions for modelling bounded responses with boundary observations. The core building block of XBX regression is the extended-support beta distribution, a censored version of a four-parameter beta distribution with the same exceedance on the left and right of \$(0, 1)\$. Hence, XBX regression is a direct extension of beta regression. We prove that beta regression and heteroscedastic normal regression with censoring at both \$0\$ and \$1\$ -- also known as the heteroscedastic two-limit tobit model in the econometrics literature -- are special cases of extended-support beta regression, depending on whether a single extra parameter is zero or infinity, respectively. To overcome identifiability issues due to the similarity of the beta and normal distributions for certain parameter values, we shrink towards beta regression by letting the extra parameter have an exponential distribution with unknown mean. A Gauss-Laguerre quadrature approximation results in efficient likelihood-based estimation and inference procedures, which the betareg R package implements since version 3.2.0. We use XBX regression to analyze investment decisions in a behavioural economics experiment about the occurrence and extent of loss aversion. In contrast to standard approaches, we capture both the probability of rational behaviour and the mean of loss aversion. Extensive comparisons with alternative approaches illustrate the effectiveness of the new model.},

The use and application of the methods and methodologies are considered to be ``necessarily vicious'' and, unfortunately, often applied after the research has been conducted. The need for applying methods before the actually research and the reasons for doing so are often stressed in the literature and courses for research and scientific writing. This includes the aspects of selecting, understanding and applying research methods for a selected project. Unfortunately, it is difficult to choose well-suited methods and too often the selected methods and methodologies do not match each other. Instead, methods are applied without knowing about the consequences the applied method have both on the other chosen methods and on the results of the work or research. This paper provides a portal of research methods and methodologies to help the students to choose and apply the most suitable methods by illustrating which methods belong together and the distinctions between the different methods.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine whether acoustic properties could be derived for English labial and alveolar nasal consonants that remain stable across vowel contexts, speakers, and syllable positions. In experiment I, critical band analyses were conducted of five tokens each of [m] and [n] followed by the vowels [i e a o u] spoken by three speakers. Comparison of the nature of the changes in the spectral patterns from the murmur to the release showed that, for labials, there was a greater change in energy in the region of Bark 5--7 relative to that of Bark 11--14, whereas, for alveolars, there was a greater change in energy from the murmur to the release in the region of Bark 11--14 relative to that of Bark 5--7. Quantitative analyses of each token indicated that over 89\% of the utterances could be appropriately classified for place of articulation by comparing the proportion of energy change in these spectral regions. In experiment II, the spectral patterns of labial and alveolar nasals produced in the context of [s]+nasal ([m n])+vowel ([i e a o u]) by two speakers were explored. The same analysis procedures were used as in experiment I. Eighty-four percent of the utterances were appropriately classified, although labial consonants were less consistently classified than in experiment I. The properties associated with nasal place of articulation found in this study are discussed in relation to those associated with place of articulation in stop consonants and are considered from the viewpoint of a more general theory of acoustic invariance.},

Many scientific articles have the goal to test a hypothesis, so making the tests of statistical predictions easier to find and access could be very beneficial. We propose an approach that can be used to make hypothesis tests machine-readable. We believe there are two benefits to specifying a hypothesis test in such a way that a computer can evaluate whether the statistical prediction is corroborated or not. First, hypothesis tests become more transparent, falsifiable, and rigorous. Second, scientists benefit if information related to hypothesis tests in scientific articles is easily findable and reusable, for example, to perform meta-analyses, conduct peer review, and examine metascientific research questions. We examine what a machine-readable hypothesis test should look like and demonstrate the feasibility of machine-readable hypothesis tests in a real-life example using the fully operational prototype R package scienceverse.},

  abstract = {This study reexamines the well-attested coda voicing effect on vowel duration [Chen, Phonetica 22, 125--159 (1970)], in conjunction with the relationship between vowel duration and aspiration of codas. The first step was to replicate the results of Maddieson and Gandour [UCLA Working Papers Phonetics 31, 46--52 (1976)] with a larger, language-specific data set. Four nonsense syllables ending in [open-o] followed by [k, kh, g, gh] were read aloud in ten different carrier sentences by four native speakers of Hindi. Results confirm that longer vowels precede voiced word-final consonants and aspirated word-final consonants. Thus, among the syllables, vowel duration would be longest when preceding the voiced aspirate [gh]. Coda voicing, and thus, vowel duration, have been shown to correlate negatively to vowel F1 in English and ARabic [Wolf, J. Phonetics 6, 299--309 (1978); de Jong and Zawaydeh ibid, 30, 53--75 (2002)]. It is not known whether vowel F1 depends directly on coda voicing, or is determined indirectly via duration. Since voicing and aspiration both increase duration, F1 measurements of this data set (which will be presented) may answer that question.}

How effective is this policy? We compared 59 papers published before, and 59 papers published after, the policy took effect. After the policy was in place, the rate of data sharing increased by more than 50\%. We further looked at whether papers published under the open data policy were reproducible, in the sense that the published results should be possible to regenerate given the data, and given the code, when code was provided. For 8 out of the 59 papers, data sets were inaccessible. The reproducibility rate ranged from 34\% to 56\%, depending on the reproducibility criteria. The strongest predictor of whether an attempt to reproduce would be successful is the presence of the analysis code: it increases the probability of reproducing reported results by almost 40\%. We propose two simple steps that can increase the reproducibility of published papers: share the analysis code, and attempt to reproduce one's own analysis using only the shared materials.},

  abstract = {From James Legge's first attempt to translate the Yijing in the English speaking world in 1854, to the latest translation, The Original Meaning of the Yijing, by Joseph A. Adler in 2019, the process of translating the Yijing into English has been continuing for nearly 170 years, and there are countless translations by numerous translators. Historically, these English translations of the Yijing reveal five trends: first, the translations rely on the authoritative, traditional commentaries on the Yijing; secondly, some translations rely on the personal help and interpretations of Yijing scholars in China; thirdly, some translations depend on recently unearthed documents of the Yijing; fourthly, Yili and Xiangshu are more or less involved in these translations, although the focus of each translation is not always the same; fifthly, most translations strive for the ``original'' meaning of the Yijing, especially with the unearthed documents of the Yijing since the 1970s. It could be safely concluded that the ultimate goal of the English translators of the Yijing is to provide English readers with the Yijing that is closest to the original/authentic meaning so that people in the West can truly understand the essence of Chinese philosophy represented by the Yijing.},

It defines a procedure for deriving a set of formant frequencies from information on the state of the lip muscles, the position of the jaw, the shape and position of the tongue body, and larynx height. The acoustic and auditory consequences of varying these parameters individually are reported. The introduction of the jaw as a separate parameter---a feature not used in previous articulatory models---makes it possible to explain why ``openness'' occurs as a universal phonetic feature of vowel production. According to the explanation proposed, the degree of opening of a vowel corresponds to a position of the jaw that is optimized in the sense that it cooperates with the tongue in producing the desired area function. Such cooperation prevents excessive tongue shape deformation. Our results suggest that, in order to reflect this principle of articulatory synergism, ``tongue height,'' although primary with respect to its acoustic consequences, should be represented as a derived feature characteristic of the final vocal-tract configuration.},

However, scholars cannot agree on which rhythmic measures discriminate rhythm classes most satisfactorily and whether the speech rate factor should be considered. In this study, we analyze speech production by bilingual speakers, and compare their production with that of monolingual speakers and ESL speakers. Our rhythmic metric measure results show that when speech rate is taken into consideration, a combination of the two metric measures for vowels,               Varco∆V               and               vocalic nPVI               , is most reliable in discriminating different rhythm classes, while consonants do not seem effective, whether the speech rate factor is included or not.}

  abstract = {Speakers have a number of options when introducing propositions which they take to be uncertain: for instance, they can use verbs such as `know', `believe' or `think'. The production of uncertainty expressions is highly context dependent. One promising approach to capturing the semantic meaning of these expressions takes them to be available only when the speaker's confidence in the proposition exceeds some threshold. However, it is unclear whether this approach deals satisfactorily with the full range of usages of uncertainty expressions. For instance, speakers may also use them to achieve social goals such as toning down the force of their assertion. In this case they pursue another communicative goal than just being cooperative: they also aim to be polite. The current study investigates the speakers' motivations in choosing between uncertainty expressions such as `believe' or the factive `know' in two controlled contexts. More specifically, we show that speakers' choice of expression is influenced by (i) how likely they estimate an event to be and (ii) strategic considerations relating to the communicative context in which they are working. Thus, speakers adjust their language as a manipulative process. We situate these results in the context of threshold semantics.}

A resonant (p, ```r.., {\textmu}, v) is almost invariably the intervening consonant, but there are secure instances of assimilation across obstruents. There are two kinds of evidence for assuming assimilation in a given word. First, the word may be attested in two forms, one with matching vowels and one with different ones; these are sometimes found in different dialects, but occasionally are different chronologically. In these cases, it is generally prudent to assume that the form showing a sequence of different vowels is more original. The second kind of argument rests upon our understanding of the distribution of ablaut grades in PIE (and hence G) morphology. Both kinds of argument are demonstrated by Att. {\textmu}E''(E0o\&lt;;, Ion. {\textmu}E''(a.0o\&lt;; `magnitude'. The certain etymology of the first part of the formation is ``mei,IJ2- (cf.

  abstract = {The present fMRI study used a spelling task to investigate the hypothesis that the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) hosts neuronal representations of whole written words. Such an orthographic word lexicon is posited by cognitive dual-route theories of reading and spelling. In the scanner, participants performed a spelling task in which they had to indicate if a visually presented letter is present in the written form of an auditorily presented word. The main experimental manipulation distinguished between an orthographic word spelling condition in which correct spelling decisions had to be based on orthographic whole-word representations, a word spelling condition in which reliance on orthographic whole-word representations was optional and a phonological pseudoword spelling condition in which no reliance on such representations was possible. To evaluate spelling-specific activations the spelling conditions were contrasted with control conditions that also presented auditory words and pseudowords, but participants had to indicate if a visually presented letter corresponded to the gender of the speaker. We identified a left vOT cluster activated for the critical orthographic word spelling condition relative to both the control condition and the phonological pseudoword spelling condition. Our results suggest that activation of left vOT during spelling can be attributed to the retrieval of orthographic whole-word representations and, thus, support the position that the left vOT potentially represents the neuronal equivalent of the cognitive orthographic word lexicon.

  abstract = {Recent controversies in psychology have spurred conversations about the nature and quality of psychological research. One topic receiving substantial attention is the role of replication in psychological science. Using the complete publication history of the 100 psychology journals with the highest 5-year impact factors, the current article provides an overview of replications in psychological research since 1900. This investigation revealed that roughly 1.6\% of all psychology publications used the term replication in text. A more thorough analysis of 500 randomly selected articles revealed that only 68\% of articles using the term replication were actual replications, resulting in an overall replication rate of 1.07\%. Contrary to previous findings in other fields, this study found that the majority of replications in psychology journals reported similar findings to their original studies (i.e., they were successful replications). However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles. Moreover, despite numerous systemic biases, the rate at which replications are being published has increased in recent decades.},

Even though, Darwinism recomposes the humanistic disjunction between reality and representation: by defining the human being as the result of an adaptive reflection, it reveals the idealistic character of post-Cartesian thought, which is the backbone of philosophical anthropocentrism. The non-human can be a dialogic entity if and only if it is considered not as Banimal-by{\textasciicircum} but Banimal-with{\textasciicircum}, that is, free to express its authenticity in terms of subjectivity, diversity and uniqueness. Whilst the post-human laboratory celebrates the power of human beings, the post-humanistic perspective emphasizes the conjugation with the non-human.},

  abstract = {Selective publication and reporting in individual papers compromise the scientific record, but are meta-analyses as compromised as their constituent studies? We systematically sampled 63 meta-analyses (each comprising at least 40 studies) in               PLoS One               , top medical journals, top psychology journals, and Metalab, an online, open-data database of developmental psychology meta-analyses. We empirically estimated publication bias in each, including only the peer-reviewed studies. Across all meta-analyses, we estimated that ``statistically significant'' results in the expected direction were only 1.17 times more likely to be published than ``nonsignificant'' results or those in the unexpected direction (95\% CI: [0.93, 1.47]), with a confidence interval substantially overlapping the null. Comparable estimates were 0.83 for meta-analyses in               PLoS One               , 1.02 for top medical journals, 1.54 for top psychology journals, and 4.70 for Metalab. The severity of publication bias did differ across individual meta-analyses; in a small minority (10\%; 95\% CI: [2\%, 21\%]), publication bias appeared to favor ``significant'' results in the expected direction by more than threefold. We estimated that for 89\% of meta-analyses, the amount of publication bias that would be required to attenuate the point estimate to the null exceeded the amount of publication bias estimated to be actually present in the vast majority of meta-analyses from the relevant scientific discipline (exceeding the 95th percentile of publication bias). Study-level measures (``statistical significance'' with a point estimate in the expected direction and point estimate size) did not indicate more publication bias in higher-tier versus lower-tier journals, nor in the earliest studies published on a topic versus later studies. Overall, we conclude that the mere act of performing a meta-analysis with a large number of studies (at least 40) and that includes non-headline results may largely mitigate publication bias in meta-analyses, suggesting optimism about the validity of meta-analytic results.},

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses."--},

Some of these controversies have been concentrated within linguistics, as in the methodological opposition of multilateral comparison to the traditional Comparative Method. Others have crossed discipline boundaries, with the question of whether correlations can be established between language families, archaeological cultures and genetic populations. At the same time, increasing emphasis on language contact has challenged the family tree as a model of linguistic relatedness. This paperagrues that we must quantify language classi{\textregistered}cation, to allow objective evaluation of alternative methods within linguistics, and of proposed cross-disciplinary correlations; and that a {\textregistered}rst step in this quanti{\textregistered}cation is represented by the `borrowing' of computational tools from biology.},

We examine the construct validity of IIT's measure of consciousness,               phi               ({$\Phi$}), by analyzing its formal properties, its relation to key aspects of consciousness, and its co-variation with relevant empirical circumstances. Our analysis shows that IIT's identification of consciousness with the causal efficacy with which differentiated networks accomplish global information transfer (which is what {$\Phi$} in fact measures) is mistaken. This misidentification has the consequence of requiring the attribution of consciousness to a range of natural systems and artifacts that include, but are not limited to, large-scale electrical power grids, gene-regulation networks, some electronic circuit boards, and social networks. Instead of treating this consequence of the theory as a disconfirmation, IIT embraces it. By regarding these systems as bearers of consciousness               ex hypothesi               , IIT is led toward the orbit of panpsychist ideation. This departure from science as we know it can be avoided by recognizing the functional misattribution at the heart of IIT's identity claim. We show, for example, what function is actually performed, at least in the human case, by the cortical combination of differentiation with integration that IIT identifies with consciousness. Finally, we examine what lessons may be drawn from IIT's failure to provide a credible account of consciousness for progress in the very active field of research concerned with exploring the phenomenon from formal and neural points of view.},

  abstract = {Mouse tracking is an important source of data in cognitive science. Most contemporary mouse tracking studies use binarychoice tasks and analyze the curvature or velocity of an individual mouse movement during an experimental trial as participants select from one of the two options. However, there are many types of mouse tracking data available beyond what is produced in a binary-choice task, including naturalistic data from web users. In order to utilize these data, cognitive scientists need tools that are robust to the lack of trial-by-trial structure in most normal computer tasks. We use singular value decomposition (SVD) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to analyze whole time series of unstructured mouse movement data. We also introduce a new technique for describing two-dimensional mouse traces as complex-valued time series, which allows SVD and DFA to be applied in a straightforward way without losing important spatial information. We find that there is useful information at the level of whole time series, and we use this information to predict performance in an online task. We also discuss how the implications of these results can advance the use of mouse tracking research in cognitive science.},

Repeated prime and target words either matched (/b{\~a}ˈ do/ -- /b{\~a}ˈ do/ ``headband'') or mismatched their stress pattern (/b{\~a}do/ -- /b{\~a}ˈ do/). In comparison to a control condition (/maʁ[Formula: see text]/ -- /b{\~a}ˈ do/), the results showed that matching and mismatching primes were equally effective in facilitating the processing of the target words. Thus, despite the fact that French speakers routinely produce and hear words in their stressed and unstressed versions, this study suggests that stress in French is not integrated into lexical representations.},

  abstract = {We live in a contemporary society surrounded by visuals, which, along with software options and electronic distribution, has created an increased importance on effective scientific visuals. Unfortunately, across scientific disciplines, many figures incorrectly present information or, when not incorrect, still use suboptimal data visualization practices. Presented here are ten principles that serve as guidance for authors who seek to improve their visual message. Some principles are less technical, such as determining the message before starting the visual, while other principles are more technical, such as how different color combinations imply different information. Because figure making is often not formally taught and figure standards are not readily enforced in science, it is incumbent upon scientists to be aware of best practices in order to most effectively tell the story of their data.},

The abstractions linguists operate with are assumed to emerge through a process of generalization over the data language users are exposed to. Here, we use two types of computational learning algorithms that differ in how they formalize and execute generalization and, consequently, abstraction, to probe whether a type of language knowledge that resembles linguistic abstractions could emerge from exposure to raw data only. More specifically, we investigated whether a phone, undisputedly the simplest of all linguistic abstractions, could emerge from exposure to speech sounds using two computational learning processes: memory-based learning and error-correction learning (ECL). Both models were presented with a significant amount of pre-processed speech produced by one speaker. We assessed (1) the consistency or stability of what these simple models learn and (2) their ability to approximate abstract categories. Both types of models fare differently regarding these tests. We show that only ECL models can learn abstractions and that at least part of the phone inventory and its grouping into traditional types can be reliably identified from the input.},

We illustrate how regression splines can be used to test for nonlinear effects of cross-language similarity in form as well as for controlling experimental trial effects. We further illustrate the tensor product smooth for a nonlinear interaction between cross-language semantic similarity and word frequency. Finally, we show how the QGAMM helps clarify whether the effect of a particular predictor is constant across distributions of RTs.},

These data were extracted from historical linguistic reconstructions and brought together into a single unified, normalized, accessible, and Unicode-compliant language resource. This dataset is publicly available and we aim to engage language scientists doing research on language change and language evolution. Furthermore, we identify a hitherto undiscussed temporal bias that complicates the simple comparison of ancient and reconstructed languages with present-day languages. Due to the sparsity of the data and the absence of statistical and computational methods that can adequately handle this bias, we instead directly target rates of change within and across families, thereby providing a case study to highlight BDPROTO's research viability; using phylogenetic comparative methods and high-resolution language family trees, we investigate whether consonantal and vocalic systems differ in their rates of change over the last 10,000 years. In light of the compilation of BDPROTO and the findings of our case study, we discuss the challenges involved in comparing the sound systems of reconstructed languages with modern day languages.},

  abstract = {Within quantitative phonetics, it is common practice to draw conclusions based on statistical significance alone. Using incomplete neutralization of final devoicing in German as a case study, we illustrate the problems with this approach. If researchers find a significant acoustic difference between voiceless and devoiced obstruents, they conclude that neutralization is incomplete; and if they find no significant difference, they conclude that neutralization is complete. However, such strong claims regarding the existence or absence of an effect based on significant results alone can be misleading. Instead, the totality of available evidence should be brought to bear on the question. Towards this end, we synthesize the evidence from 14 studies on incomplete neutralization in German using a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis provides evidence in favor of incomplete neutralization. We conclude with some suggestions for improving the quality of future research on phonetic phenomena: ensure that sample sizes allow for high-precision estimates of the effect; avoid the temptation to deploy researcher degrees of freedom when analyzing data; focus on estimates of the parameter of interest and the uncertainty about that parameter; attempt to replicate effects found; and, whenever possible, make both the data and analysis available publicly.}

By using this paradigm, two experiments were carried out to test: 1) if/how this implicit phonetic imitation interacts with linguistic representations when the change might impair linguistic contrast; 2) whether phonetic imitation can be generalized, and 3) whether word-level specificity can be obtained through physical measurements of a phonetic feature. The results revealed a significant effect of implicit phonetic imitation for extended VOTs, although there was no imitation observed for reduced VOTs. Furthermore, the imitated feature (extended VOT) was generalized to new instances of the target phoneme /p/ as well as to the new segment /k/. These results indicate that 1) knowledge of phonemic contrast modulates the implicit phonetic imitation, and 2) speakers possess sub-phonemic representations. Expected word specificity was not observed in the data.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders encompass complex aberrations of cognition and affect and are among the most debilitating and poorly understood of any medical condition. Current treatments rely primarily on interventions that target brain function (drugs) or learning processes (psychotherapy). A mechanistic understanding of how these interventions mediate their therapeutic effects remains elusive. From the early 1990s, non-invasive functional neuroimaging, coupled with parallel developments in the cognitive neurosciences, seemed to signal a new era of neurobiologically grounded diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Yet, despite three decades of intense neuroimaging research, we still lack a neurobiological account for any psychiatric condition. Likewise, functional neuroimaging plays no role in clinical decision making. Here, we offer a critical commentary on this impasse and suggest how the field might fare better and deliver impactful neurobiological insights.},

  abstract = {Vowels, a fundamental component of human speech across all languages, are cued acoustically by formants, resonance frequencies of the vocal tract shape during speaking. An outstanding question in neurolinguistics is how formants are processed neurally during speech perception. To address this, we collected high-density intracranial recordings from the human speech cortex on the superior temporal gyrus (STG) while participants listened to continuous speech. We found that two-dimensional receptive fields based on the first two formants provided the best characterization of vowel sound representation. Neural activity at single sites was highly selective for zones in this formant space. Furthermore, formant tuning is adjusted dynamically for speaker-specific spectral context. However, the entire population of formant-encoding sites was required to accurately decode single vowels. Overall, our results reveal that complex acoustic tuning in the two-dimensional formant space underlies local vowel representations in STG. As a population code, this gives rise to phonological vowel perception.},

  abstract = {There are arbitrary decisions to be made (i.e., researcher degrees of freedom) in the execution and reporting of most research. These decisions allow for many possible outcomes from a single study. Selective reporting of results from this `multiverse' of outcomes, whether intentional (p-hacking) or not, can lead to inflated effect size estimates and false positive results in the literature. In this study, we examine and illustrate the consequences of researcher degrees of freedom in primary research, both for primary outcomes and for subsequent meta-analyses. We used a set of 10 preregistered multi-lab direct replication projects from psychology (Registered Replication Reports) with a total of 14 primary outcome variables, 236 labs and 37,602 participants. By exploiting researcher degrees of freedom in each project, we were able to compute between 3,840 and 2,621,440 outcomes per lab. We show that researcher degrees of freedom in primary research can cause substantial variability in effect size that we denote the Underlying Multiverse Variability (UMV). In our data, the median UMV across labs was 0.1 standard deviations (interquartile range = 0.09 -- 0.15). In one extreme case, the effect size estimate could change by d = 1.27, evidence that p-hacking in some (rare) cases can provide support for almost any conclusion. We also show that researcher degrees of freedom in primary research provide another source of uncertainty in meta-analysis beyond those usually estimated. This would not be a large concern for meta-analysis if researchers made all arbitrary decisions at random. However, emulating selective reporting of lab results led to inflation of meta-analytic average effect size estimates in our data by as much as 0.1 - 0.48 standard deviations, depending to a large degree on the number of possible outcomes at the lab level (i.e., multiverse size). Our results illustrate the importance of making research decisions transparent (e.g., through preregistration and multiverse analysis), evaluating studies for selective reporting, and whenever feasible making raw data available.},

There is an ever-growing research body focusing on adjudicating whether there is, in fact, an effect of using two or more languages regularly on cognition. In this paper, we briefly review some of the more pertinent literature that has attempted to identify attenuating, modulating, and confounding factors in research comparing monolingual and bilingual populations, and we highlight issues that should be taken into account in future research to move forward as a research community. At the same time, we argue for a change in perspective concerning what is deemed an advantage and what is not and argue for more ecologically valid research that investigates real-life advantages.},

  abstract = {In this work I intend to discuss some general properties of dialectal variation which have import on the theory of language acquisition. I will first briefly discuss whether dialectal variation is qualitatively different from typological variation, a prediction made by a theory which assumes that there exist macro- and microparameters, as dialectal variation should only display microparameters. As this is not the case, I argue against the idea of a hierarchical order of parameters that the child has to set progressively in language acquisition, and in favor of an idea of a constellation of abstract properties connected by the fact that they share some primitive components that cluster to form what we call ``formal features'' in a way similar to how articulatory features cluster to combine phonemes. The second part of the article deals with what is indeed peculiar to dialectal variation, namely the type of distribution called ``leopard spots'' by traditional dialectologists and puts forth the idea that it can be used to formulate more precise hypotheses on the structure of functional items inside a framework like the cartographic/ nano-syntax one.},

Noticeably, in contrast to vowels /y {\oe}/, the back vowel /ɯ/ showed variable patterns of adaptation. The conclusion drawn from the paper was that the vowel /ɯ/ was different from other vowels. Interestingly, the Turkish vowel inventory is a crowded vowel system with three rounded/unrounded vowel pairs, two front vowel pairs (/i y/ and /e {\oe}/), and one back vowel pair (/ɯ u/). And, while phonetic research has largely focused on front vowel pairs in other languages, I emphasize on the importance of the back vowel pair.},

  abstract = {The diffusion decision model allows detailed explanations of behavior in two-choice discrimination tasks. In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data---accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions---into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

  abstract = {"The 3,000 year old I Ching is the most esteemed of the ancient Chinese classics, yet also the most enigmatic. Reading the I Ching (Book of Changes) incorporates recent advances in scholarship, such as recently excavated texts, and demonstrates how the Zhouyi (the ancient textual layer of the I Ching) was compiled from mostly oral material and how it was organized to serve as an easily consulted compendium of divination responses. In this book Geoffrey Redmond clarifies the meanings of the ancient text by examining use of literary devices such as prognostic terms, imagery from daily life, rhetorical tropes, metaphors, proverbs and set phrases. This provides insight on how the Zhouyi was composed and explains its use for divination. It also shows how, centuries later, the Zhouyi was adapted by the Confucians, who believed it to be the creation of ancient sages, and the source of their metaphysics and cosmology. Redmond also analyzes the Changes through a variety of philological heuristics, such as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, methods of analogy and anomaly, the distinction between argumentative and context dependence, as well as modern approaches such as Jungian psychology, and critical theory. Included are the interlinear Chinese text, and a glossary of key words in English, Chinese, and pinyin, making it essential reading for students studying Chinese philosophy, Chinese religion, and early Chinese history, as well as readers looking for a clear and accessible gloss of this text."},

  abstract = {Abstract             A network of left frontal and temporal brain regions supports language processing. This ``core'' language network stores our knowledge of words and constructions as well as constraints on how those combine to form sentences. However, our linguistic knowledge additionally includes information about phonemes and how they combine to form phonemic clusters, syllables, and words. Are phoneme combinatorics also represented in these language regions? Across five functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we investigated the sensitivity of high-level language processing brain regions to sublexical linguistic regularities by examining responses to diverse nonwords---sequences of phonemes that do not constitute real words (e.g. punes, silory, flope). We establish robust responses in the language network to visually (experiment 1a, n\,=\,605) and auditorily (experiments 1b, n\,=\,12, and 1c, n\,=\,13) presented nonwords. In experiment 2 (n\,=\,16), we find stronger responses to nonwords that are more well-formed, i.e. obey the phoneme-combinatorial constraints of English. Finally, in experiment 3 (n\,=\,14), we provide suggestive evidence that the responses in experiments 1 and 2 are not due to the activation of real words that share some phonology with the nonwords. The results suggest that sublexical regularities are stored and processed within the same fronto-temporal network that supports lexical and syntactic processes.},

The corpus comprises 100 h of audio recordings taken from 200 audiobooks and covers a wide range of topics with a rich vocabulary. The audio recordings were transcribed manually, strictly verbatim, and listened to carefully several times to ensure accuracy. The corpus was evaluated using various end-to-end models as well as Transformer-based architectures. The evaluation was conducted on both the training and testing sets, with Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) being considered as evaluation metrics. The results of the architectures trained with this corpus were compared with the results of the LibriSpeech corpus in English. The best architecture based on end-to-end models yielded 5\% WER and 1\% CER on the training set and 35\% WER and 11\% CER on the testing set. The transformer-based architecture yielded great results in the testing set, reaching a WER of 18\%.},

In questa sede si ha modo di aggiornare l'unica descrizione fonetica del modenese inora disponibile, pubblicata da Bertoni nel 1905, rendendo conto della situazione del dialetto di citt{\`a} parlato attualmente e dei contributi oferti dagli studi pi{\`u} recenti.

  abstract = {To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that ''sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.'' Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median's bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate the hierarchical shift function, a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation. All the code and data to reproduce the figures and analyses in the article are available online.},

Presently, there is evidence both for and against such an advantage. Interestingly, the evidence in favor has been thought strongest in children and older adults, leading some researchers to argue that young adults might be at peak performance levels, and therefore bilingualism is unable to confer an improvement. We conducted a large-scale review of the extant literature and found that the weight of research pointed to an absence of positive evidence for a bilingual advantage at any age. We next gave a large number of young adult participants a task designed to test the bilingual advantage hypothesis. Reasoning from the literature that young adults from an East Asian (Korean) culture would likely outperform those from a Western (British) culture, we also compared participants on this factor. We found no evidence for a bilingual advantage but did find evidence for enhanced performance in the Korean group. We interpret these results as further evidence against the bilingual advantage hypotheses.},

At the same time, meta-scientific attempts to assess the crisis in more detail have reported substantial difficulties in identifying unambiguous definitions of the scientific claims in published articles and determining how they are connected to the presented evidence. I argue that most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure---they are                 not even wrong                 . Meta-scientists should beware of the flawed assumption that the psychological literature is a collection of well-defined claims. To move beyond the crisis, psychologists must reconsider and rebuild the conceptual basis of their hypotheses before trying to test them.},

  abstract = {Associations between assessment and learning are widely studied and often organized around the notions of Assessment as Learning (AaL), Assessment for Learning (AfL), and Assessment of Learning (AoL). Although these notions are appealing in theory, the notions are unclear constructs to comprehend, as both their definitions and their practice are used inconsistently in educational research. We present a synthesis of common characteristics among these notions, based on a scoping review on definitions and descriptions of AaL, AfL, and AoL (131 studies). The synthesis of common characteristics consists of nine themes that refer to how educational assessment relates to learning. The themes are grouped into: 1) Student-teacher roles and relationships within assessment; 2) Assessment learning environment; and 3) Educational outcomes of assessment. Then, we used the themes within the synthesis to analyze the results of the included empirical studies on their contributions to practice (84 studies). The synthesis provides stakeholders with a clear and integrative view of how educational assessment relates to learning and may be beneficial to educators to support and design their assessment practices. We argue that the notions of AaL, AfL, and AoL should be seen in coherence with one another in order to establish an assessment culture that facilitates students' learning maximally.},

  abstract = {Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering, based on local least-squares fitting of the data by polynomials, is a popular method for smoothing data and calculations of derivatives of noisy data. At frequencies above the cutoff, SG filters have poor noise suppression; this unnecessarily reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when calculating derivatives of the data. In addition, SG filtering near the boundaries of the data range is prone to artifacts, which are especially strong when using SG filters for calculating derivatives of the data. We show how these disadvantages can be avoided while keeping the advantageous properties of SG filters. We present two classes of finite impulse response (FIR) filters with substantially improved frequency response: (i) SG filters with fitting weights in the shape of a window function and (ii) convolution kernels based on the sinc function with a Gaussian-like window function and additional corrections for improving the frequency response in the passband (modified sinc kernel). Compared with standard SG filters, the only price to pay for the improvement is a moderate increase in the kernel size. Smoothing at the boundaries of the data can be improved with a non-FIR method, the Whittaker-Henderson smoother, or by linear extrapolation of the data, followed by convolution with a modified sinc kernel, and we show that the latter is preferable in most cases. We provide computer programs and equations for the smoothing parameters of these smoothers when used as plug-in replacements for SG filters and describe how to choose smoothing parameters to preserve peak heights in spectra.},

With the current steep rise in corpus sizes, computational power, statistical literacy and multi-purpose software tools, and inspired by neighbouring disciplines, approaches have diversified to an extent that calls for an intensification of the accompanying critical debate. Bringing together a team of leading experts, this book follows a unique design, comparing advanced methods and approaches current in corpus linguistics, to stimulate reflective evaluation and discussion. Each chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of different datasets and techniques, presenting a case study and allowing readers to gauge methodological options in practice. Contributions also provide suggestions for further reading, and data and analysis scripts are included in an online appendix. This is an important and timely volume, and will be essential reading for any linguist interested in corpus-linguistic approaches to variation and change.},

In this book (published in the US as Science Set Free), Dr Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world's most innovative scientists, shows that science is being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. The 'scientific worldview' has become a belief system. All reality is material or physical. The world is a machine, made up of dead matter. Nature is purposeless. Consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain. Free will is an illusion. God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls. Sheldrake examines these dogmas scientifically, and shows persuasively that science would be better off without them: freer, more interesting, and more fun.In The God Delusion Richard Dawkins used science to bash God, but here Rupert Sheldrake shows that Dawkins' understanding of what science can do is old-fashioned and itself a delusion},

  abstract = {Abstract             In G, a vowel, usually e-but sometimes ex-or o-, appears before resonant consonants in word-initial position. Such a vowel invariably develops before an original initial ..r-; less commonly before ..!-, ..m-, ..n-, and ..w-; and never before ``y-. (For the special behavior of ``y-, see 191.) The term prothetic vowel is reserved for vowels that have no self-evident PIE source, either in ablaut alternations or as a morphological prefix. Some of them are now generally agreed to reflect word-initial laryngeals (90). LARYNGALS AND PROTHETIC VOWELS. A number of G prothetic vowels are the presumably regular outcomes of word-initial laryngeals rather than spontaneously generated within G. For example, G \&(f\vphantom\{\}r,\&lt;n `blows' was traditionally traced to PIE ``we- (that is, ``weH,) `blow' with prothetic a-. But now Hitt.vhu-u-wa-an-te-ef'winds' \&lt; ``H2uHront- (556) re\- quires instead ``H2weH,, such that Gar- is seen to come from ``H2w-. G a.Eiow `speak' and Ved. viivad1ti `declares' together point to a reduplicated pres. (451A) ``H2we-H2wed- (Indic), ``H2we-H2ud- (G), from a root ``H2wed- (Indic ii\&lt; ``-eH-; G fEi \&lt; ``wew, 61.rn).1 Similarly, PIE ``nogwh-/ ``ongwh- `nail, hoof' (100b); this, the traditional reconstruction, supposes implausibly elaborate ablaut for an underived form, and can be replaced to advantage by *H1nogwh-, whence PG ``onoks \&gt; G ovu (44), L unguis (100b). Such an etymon also accounts elegantly for {\textmu}wvu `single-hooved' (107).},

  abstract = {It is hard to define structural categories of language (e.g. noun, verb, adjective) in a way which accounts for linguistic variation. This leads Haspelmath to make the following claims: i) unlike in biology and chemistry, there are no natural kinds in language; ii) there is a fundamental distinction between descriptive and comparative linguistic categories, and; iii) generalisations based on comparisons between languages can in principle tell us nothing about specific languages. The implication is that cross-linguistic categories cannot support scientific induction. I disagree: generalisations on the basis of linguistic comparison should inform the language sciences. Haspelmath is not alone in identifying a connection between the nature of the categories we use and the kind of inferences we can make (e.g. Goodman's `new riddle of induction'), but he is both overly pessimistic about categories in language and overly optimistic about categories in other sciences: biology and even chemistry work with categories which are indeterminate to some degree. Linguistic categories are clusters of cooccurring properties with variable instantiations, but this does not mean that we should dispense with them: if linguistic generalisations reliably lead to predictions about individual languages, and if we can integrate them into more sophisticated causal explanations, then there is no a priori requirement for a fundamental descriptive/comparative distinction. Instead, we should appreciate linguistic variation as a key component of our explanations rather than a problem to be dealt with.},

  abstract = {In many research fields, the widespread use of questionable research practices has jeopardized the credibility of scientific results. One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p-hacking. Typically, p-hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of twelve p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.},

  abstract = {This study explores how perceptual sensitivities to contextual variability extend to prosodically induced variation. In English, vowel duration is reliably longer preceding a voiced obstruent, as opposed to a voiceless obstruent, and listeners use preceding length as a cue to obstruent voicing (e.g. Raphael, 1972). Segmental duration also co-varies systematically with prosodic position, being longer phrase-finally (e.g. Turk \& Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2007). In this study, we tested the extent to which listeners' categorization of word-final obstruents is altered by the prosodic position of the target. Participants heard a continuum that varied only in vowel length, and categorized stimuli as either ``coat'' or ``code''. Prosodic position in a carrier phrase was manipulated by splicing the target word into either a phrase-final or phrase-medial context. Results show listener expectations about phrase final lengthening mediate categorization, with significantly longer vowel durations required in phrase-final position for a ``code'' response. The results are discussed in terms of other top-down influences on segmental categorization (e.g. lexical information), and implications for further work on the prosody-phonetics interface.}

  abstract = {Abstract             The primary aims of peer review are to detect flaws and deficiencies in the design and interpretation of studies, and ensure the clarity and quality of their presentation. However, it has been questioned whether peer review fulfils this function. Studies have highlighted a stronger focus of reviewers on critiquing methodological aspects of studies and the quality of writing in biomedical sciences, with less focus on theoretical grounding. In contrast, reviewers in the social sciences appear more concerned with theoretical underpinnings. These studies also found the effect of peer review on manuscripts' content to be variable, but generally modest and positive. I qualitatively analysed 1430 peer reviewers' comments for a sample of 40 social science preprint-publication pairs to identify the key foci of reviewers' comments. I then quantified the effect of peer review on manuscripts by examining differences between the preprint and published versions using the normalised Levenshtein distance, cosine similarity, and word count ratios for titles, abstracts, document sections and full-texts. I also examined changes in references used between versions and linked changes to reviewers' comments. Reviewers' comments were nearly equally split between issues of methodology (30.7\%), theory (30.0\%), and writing quality (29.2\%). Titles, abstracts, and the semantic content of documents remained similar, although publications were typically longer than preprints. Two-thirds of citations were unchanged, 20.9\% were added during review and 13.1\% were removed. These findings indicate reviewers equally attended to the theoretical and methodological details and communication style of manuscripts, although the effect on quantitative measures of the manuscripts was limited.},

To do so, we used an online educational program called 3DGameLab to convert what had been a well-liked face-to-face lecture and discussion course to an online format, for the purposes of long-distance teaching and learning. Within 3DGameLab, we prepared approximately three times as much content as would be taught in a face-to-face class. Clear tasks and immediate rewards in the form of experience points (XP) contributed to a transparent motivational system as compared to traditional grading. In this course, students completed their assignments asynchronously. Sustaining engagement is challenging in this format due to student self-management, but, with the game mode, students could repeat their attempts to pass a quest (a lesson) until they succeed (submit a passable response). The feedback cycle was short, and we found that students tend to persevere in the face of failure when they get rapid feedback, rather than quit. To test the adaptability of the asynchronous, gamified format, we also designed this course as a hybrid course. Students remained engaged when the feedback was quick, and the tasks were clearly set. We did not perform a quantitative study; the purpose of this article is to share a design study of our methods and subsequent experience with these modalities.},

The paper does not provide a one-size-fits-all set of guidelines for specific practices to use (e.g., one platform on which to back up data); instead, it gives examples of ways that mistakes can occur in research along with recommendations for systems that avoid and detect them. This paper also encourages cultivating a lab culture of looking for mistakes to ensure that all findings are checked and lab members are comfortable disclosing when they find errors. This tutorial is intended to be used as a discussion prompt prior to a lab meeting to help researchers reflect on their own processes and implement safeguards to avoid future errors.},

Estimates from these studies varied due to differences in methods and scope. Unlike other disciplines, there was no reliable lower bound prevalence estimate of scientific misconduct based on identified cases available for psychology. Thus, we conducted an additional empirical investigation on the basis of retractions in the database PsycINFO. Our analyses showed that 0.82 per 10,000 journal articles in psychology were retracted due to scientific misconduct. Between the late 1990s and 2012, there was a steep increase. Articles retracted due to scientific misconduct were identified in 20 out of 22 PsycINFO subfields. These results show that measures aiming to reduce scientific misconduct should be promoted equally across all psychological subfields.},

In the absence of a theoretical or methodological consensus, different articulatory studies of vowels rely on different measures, which leads to lack of comparability between different sets of results. This paper addresses the problem of how to parametrise the tongue measurements relevant to vowels, obtained from midsagittal articulatory imaging. We focus on the lax vowels subsystem in Northern Anglo-English. A range of measures quantifying tongue position, height, and shape are extracted from an ultrasound dataset representing 40 speakers. These measures are compared, based on how well they capture the lingual contrast between different vowels, how stable they are across different speakers, and how intercorrelated they are. The results suggest that different measures are preferred for different vowels, which supports a multi-dimensional approach in quantifying vowel articulation.},

  abstract = {YouTube is the second-most visited webpage in the world and boasts over 2 billion users and 500 h of videos uploaded every hour. Despite this popularity, relatively few articles have discussed the practical use of searching and YouTube as a research tool and source of data. The purpose of our paper is to propose a step-by-step schematic for utilizing the YouTube platform. Our discussions include (a) when/whether to use YouTube for research; (b) selecting an appropriate research design; (c) how to search for YouTube data; (d) what data can be pulled from YouTube; and (e) the contextual limitations for interpreting YouTube data. Further, we provide practical strategies and considerations when searching, collecting, or interpreting YouTube data. These discussions are informed by our own work using the YouTube platform. Effective methods used to search for YouTube data are likely to extend beyond simply searching the platform itself; the search strategy and search results themselves should also be documented. While not exhaustive, we feel these considerations and strategies present themselves as a conceptual foothold for future research using the YouTube platform.},

  abstract = {Scientific research is often characterized by schools of thought. We investigate whether these divisions arise in part from differences in researchers' cognitive traits such as their tolerance for ambiguity and the vividness of their visual imagery. These differences may guide researchers to prefer different types of problems, to tackle the same problems in different ways, and perhaps even reach different conclusions when studying the same problems in the same way. We surveyed 7973 researchers in psychology and allied disciplines and investigated links between what they research (area, topic, methodology), their stances on open questions in psychological science, and a set of validated scales assessing a variety of cognitive traits and dispositions. We also linked responses to publication histories from which we constructed landscapes of similarity and difference based on publication titles and abstracts, citations and co-authorship patterns. Our results show that researchers' stances on scientific questions are, as expected, predictable from what kind of research they do. But they are also predictable from their cognitive traits, even when controlling for their research areas, methods and topics and co-authorship and citation patterns. These findings support the idea that divisions in scientific fields reflect not only differences in the kinds of data brought to bear on a topic, but also differences in the researchers themselves, hinting that the divisions may be more difficult to bridge than suggested by the traditional model of data-driven scientific consensus.},

Good theories are those that help facilitate this process by being hard to vary: They explain what they are supposed to explain, they are consistent with other good theories, and they are not easily adaptable to explain anything. Here we argue that, rather than a lack of distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research, an abundance of flexible theories is a better explanation for the current replicability problems of psychology. We also explain why popular methods-oriented solutions fail to address the real problem of flexibility. Instead, we propose that a greater emphasis on theory criticism by argument might improve replicability.},

We present word-medial stop burst data from nine speakers, examining duration, formant, spectral moment and spectral tilt measures. Our particular focus is on the apical contrast (alveolar /               t               / vs. retroflex /ʈ/) and on the alveo-palatal /               c               / vs. velar /               k               / contrast. We observe differences between the palatal and the velar depending on vowel context, and we discuss the possible aerodynamic and acoustic sources for these differences. By contrast, we find that differences between the alveolar and the retroflex are minimal in all three vowel contexts. Unexpectedly, in the context of /               i               /, various spectral measures suggest that the articulatory release for the retroflex /ʈ/ is in fact more anterior than the release for the alveolar /               t               / -- we discuss this result in terms of possible articulatory overshoot of the target for /ʈ/ before /               i               /, and suggest that this result provides additional explanation for the cross-linguistic rarity of retroflexes in an /               i               / vowel context.},

It abounds with data, such as acoustic speech recordings, neuroimaging data, or articulatory data. In this article, we provide an introduction to different areas of phonetics (acoustic phonetics, sociophonetics, speech perception, articulatory phonetics, speech inversion, sound change, and speech technology), an overview of the statistical methods for analyzing their data, and an introduction to the signal processing methods commonly applied to speech recordings. A major transition in the statistical modeling of phonetic data has been the shift from fixed effects to random effects regression models, the modeling of curve data (for instance, via generalized additive mixed models or functional data analysis methods), and the use of Bayesian methods. This shift has been driven in part by the increased focus on large speech corpora in phonetics, which has arisen from machine learning methods such as forced alignment. We conclude by identifying opportunities for future research.},

Concerns about the statistical implications of such effects have increased the popularity of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), a powerful technique for modeling wiggly patterns. We question these statistical concerns and investigate the costs and benefits of using GAMMs relative to linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs). In two sets of Monte Carlo simulations, LMEMs that ignored time-varying effects were no more prone to false positives than GAMMs. Although GAMMs generally boosted power for within-subject effects, they reduced power for between-subject effects, sometimes to a severe degree. Our results signal the importance of proper subject-level randomization as the main defense against statistical artifacts due to by-trial fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Despite strong evidence that cognitive representations of speech targets rely upon a mapping between perceptual and motor memories, the nature of those representations---whether they are stored exclusively as abstract categories or can incorporate more detailed episodic memory---remains an open question. A primed vowel-shadowing experiment was conducted to investigate the extent to which the recent perception of subphonemic details of vowel quality can influence subsequent productions. If such effects are observed, they argue for an exemplar-based model of production in which the mapping between perceptual and articulatory representations can occur rapidly and can incorporate subphonemic detail. On experimental trials, subjects were primed with one vowel before they heard a second vowel, which they shadowed. On some trials, the formants of the prime were subtly manipulated. Significant subphonemic priming effects were observed in the F1 and F2 of responses. In addition, cross-phonemic priming tended to be dissimilatory, which may be related to an analogous phenomenon observed in studies of manual and oculomotor movement control. Accounts of these findings are discussed in the context of exemplar models of speech perception and production.},

  abstract = {The goals of this paper are (1) to discuss the key features of existing articulatory models of speech production that govern their approaches to timing, along with advantages and disadvantages of each, and (2) to evaluate these features in terms of several pieces of evidence from both the speech and nonspeech motor control literature. This evidence includes greater timing precision at movement endpoints compared to other parts of movements, suggesting the separate control of the timing of movement endpoints compared to other parts of movement. This endpoint timing precision challenges models in which all parts of a movement trajectory are controlled by the same equation of motion, but supports models in which (a) abstract, symbolic phonological representations map onto spatial and temporal characteristics of the part(s) of movement most closely related to the goal of producing a planned set of acoustic cues to signal the phonological contrast (often the endpoint), (b) movements are coordinated primarily based on the goal-related part of movement, and (c) speakers give priority to the accurate implementation of the part(s) of movement most closely related to the phonological goals. In addition, this paper presents three types of evidence for phonology-extrinsic timing, suggesting that surface duration requirements are represented during speech production. Phonology-extrinsic timing is also supported by greater timing variability for repetitions of longer intervals, assumed to be due to noise in a general-purpose (and phonology-extrinsic) timekeeping process. The evidence appears to be incompatible with models that have a unified Phonology/Phonetics Component, that do not represent the surface timing of phonetic events, and do not represent, specify and track timing by general-purpose timekeeping mechanisms. Taken together, this evidence supports an alternative approach to modeling speech production that is based on symbolic phonological representations and generalpurpose, phonology-extrinsic, timekeeping mechanisms, rather than on spatio-temporal phonological representations and phonology-specific timing mechanisms. Thus, the evidence suggests that models in that alternative framework should be developed, so they can be tested with the same rigor as have models based on spatio-temporal phonological representations with phonology-intrinsic timing.},

  abstract = {Health professions education (HPE) researchers are regularly asked to articulate their use of theory, theoretical frameworks, and conceptual frameworks in their research. However, all too often, these words are used interchangeably or without a clear understanding of the differences between these concepts. Further problematizing this situation is the fact that               theory               ,               theoretical framework               , and               conceptual framework               are terms that are used in different ways in different research approaches. In this article, the authors set out to clarify the meaning of these terms and to describe how they are used in 2 approaches to research commonly used in HPE: the objectivist deductive approach (from theory to data) and the subjectivist inductive approach (from data to theory). In addition to this, given that within subjectivist inductive research               theory               ,               theoretical framework               , and               conceptual framework               can be used in different ways, they describe 3 uses that HPE researchers frequently rely on:               fully inductive theory development               ,               fully theory-informed inductive               , and               theory-informing inductive data analysis.},

Focusing primarily on frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed models, I illustrate some defensible ways in which statistical inference---specifically, hypothesis testing using Bayes factors vs. estimation or uncertainty quantification---can be carried out. The key is to not overstate the evidence and to not expect too much from statistics. Along the way, I demonstrate some powerful ideas, the most important ones being using simulation to understand the design properties of one's experiment before running it, visualizing data before carrying out a formal analysis, and simulating data from the fitted model to understand the model's behavior.},

Bayesian hierarchical models provide an intuitive account of inter- and intraindividual variability and are particularly suited for the evaluation of repeated-measures designs. Here, we provide guidance for model specification and interpretation in Bayesian hierarchical modeling and describe common pitfalls that can arise in the process of model fitting and evaluation. Our introduction gives particular emphasis to prior specification and prior sensitivity, as well as to the calculation of Bayes factors for model comparisons. We illustrate the use of state-of-the-art software programs Stan and               brms               . The result is an overview of best practices in Bayesian hierarchical modeling that we hope will aid psychologists in making the best use of Bayesian hierarchical modeling.},

  abstract = {Data generation, collection, and analysis is occurring at an unimaginable scale today. Machine learning and data analytics are new fields that focus on modelling for business decision making and prediction. In engineering and science disciplines data handling is dominated by functional analysis delivering data smoothing, fitting, modelling, and prediction. In this pursuit the data is transformed into mathematical representations that is more portable and lends easily to additional processing. They can also serve as a surrogate stand-in in for more complex analysis. While B-splines are the basic tool for functional data analysis, in many instances B{\'e}zier functions have represented and smoothed the original data with excellent fidelity. In this paper we introduce the natural B{\'e}zier functions and demonstrate that it delivers similar performance in fitting data and extracting additional information. The natural B{\'e}zier function employs a simple constraint on the vertices of the regular B{\'e}zier function and in the process transfers the properties of the fitted function from the parameter space to the function space. The natural B{\'e}zier functions are eminently portable and can be represented by a simple numerical arrays. Three examples are used to illustrate the smoothing and fitting properties of these functions based on sparse data.},

Unlike most previous studies of mora-timing in Japanese, this article investigates timing in spontaneous speech. Predictability of word duration from number of moras is found to be much weaker than in careful speech. Furthermore, the number of moras predicts word duration only slightly better than number of segments. Syllable structure also has a significant effect on word duration. Finally, comparison of the predictability of whole words and arbitrarily truncated words shows better predictability for truncated words, which would not be possible if the truncated portion were compensating for remaining moras. The results support an accumulative model of variance with a final lengthening effect, and do not indicate the presence of any compensation related to mora-timing. It is suggested that the rhythm of Japanese derives from several factors about the structure of the language, not from durational compensation.},

  abstract = {In this study we apply hierarchical spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs to a Dutch dialect dataset to cluster dialect varieties and determine the concomitant sound correspondences. An important advantage of this clustering method over other dialectometric methods is that the linguistic basis is simultaneously determined, bridging the gap between traditional and quantitative dialectology. Besides showing that the results of the hierarchical clustering improve over the flat spectral clustering method used in an earlier study (Wieling and Nerbonne, 2009), the values of the second singular vector used to generate the two-way clustering can be used to identify the most important sound correspondences for each cluster. This is an important advantage of the hierarchical method as it obviates the need for external methods to determine the most important sound correspondences for a geographical cluster.},

This survey article first reviews the field briefly in order to focus on developments in the past five years. Dialectometry no longer focuses exclusively on aggregate analyses, but rather deploys various techniques to identify representative and distinctive features with respect to areal classifications. Analyses proceeding explicitly from geostatistical techniques have just begun. The exclusive focus on geography as explanation for variation has given way to analyses combining geographical, linguistic, and social factors underlying language variation. Dialectometry has likewise ventured into diachronic studies and has also contributed theoretically to comparative dialectology and the study of dialect diffusion. Although the bulk of research involves lexis and phonology, morphosyntax is receiving increasing attention. Finally, new data sources and new (online) analytical software are expanding dialectometry's remit and its accessibility.},

  abstract = {Vowel duration is determined by a number of factors in American English (e.g., Klatt, 1976), including the tense vs. lax distinction (e.g., /i/-/ɪ/, /u/-/ʊ/) and the relation between duration and vowel height (e.g., Lehiste, 1970). A large body of research has identified segment-internal factors in data averaged over many speakers (e.g., Crystal and House, 1988; Hillenbrand et al., 1995), but few studies have investigated the inherent vowel duration patterns of individuals (cf. House, 1961). Stressed vowel productions ({$>$}2 million tokens) were identified by forced alignment in connected speech recordings of 390 speakers (209 female) from the Mixer 6 corpus (Chodroff et al., 2016). For each speaker, mean durations of ten stressed vowels (/i ɪ e {$\varepsilon$} {\ae} a ʌ o ʊ u/) were calculated after outlier exclusion. The resulting duration patterns were strongly correlated across pairs of speakers (Pearson r: mean = 0.936, 95\% CI [0.935, 0.936], range [0.559, 0.999]), and PCA identified a single component, plausibly indexing global speaking rate, that accounted for more than 82\% of the variance. These results establish that inherent vowel duration is highly uniform across speakers, a type of structured phonetic variation that has implications for models of perceptual adaptation.}

We present PCA as a methodology, with information aimed at readers who may themselves want to use it in a related context. We consider tests for the appropriateness of PCA, how to select Principal Components, and how to interpret them once they have been found. At each stage, we provide code in the R programing language to enable readers to both follow our analysis and apply the same methods to their own data.},

New or better Indo-European reconstructions (e.g. *melyos and *ku-melyos `horse; stallion'; IE. *kǝnkilos and *kǝnkanos `horse', as well as the root *kǝnk-) in reference to the animal terminology are suggested. The distribution of the reflexes of IE. *e{\^k} wos `horse' and *kǝnkilos / *kǝnkanos `id.' in the area of the Hispanic Peninsula is carefully explained. Finally it is concluded that the horse and bull were the most esteemed animals in the culture of the ancient Lusitanians.},

We argue that the foundations for a data literate society begin by acquiring key data literacy competences in school. However, as yet there is no clear definition of what these should be. This paper explores the different perspectives currently offered on both data and statistical literacy and then critically examines to what extent these address the data literacy needs of citizens in today's society. We survey existing approaches to teaching data literacy in schools, to identify how data literacy is interpreted in practice. Based on these analyses, we propose a definition of data literacy that is focused on using data to understand real world phenomena. The contribution of this paper is the creation of a common foundation for teaching and learning data literacy skills.},

Here, we investigate the use of pose estimation deep neural nets with transfer learning to perform markerless estimation of speech articulator keypoints using only a few hundred hand-labelled images as training input. Midsagittal ultrasound images of the tongue, jaw, and hyoid and camera images of the lips were hand-labelled with keypoints, trained using DeepLabCut and evaluated on unseen speakers and systems. Tongue surface contours interpolated from estimated and hand-labelled keypoints produced an average mean sum of distances (MSD) of 0.93, s.d. 0.46 mm, compared with 0.96, s.d. 0.39 mm, for two human labellers, and 2.3, s.d. 1.5 mm, for the best performing edge detection algorithm. A pilot set of simultaneous electromagnetic articulography (EMA) and ultrasound recordings demonstrated partial correlation among three physical sensor positions and the corresponding estimated keypoints and requires further investigation. The accuracy of the estimating lip aperture from a camera video was high, with a mean MSD of 0.70, s.d. 0.56 mm compared with 0.57, s.d. 0.48 mm for two human labellers. DeepLabCut was found to be a fast, accurate and fully automatic method of providing unique kinematic data for tongue, hyoid, jaw, and lips.},

  abstract = {Functional data analysis (FDA) is a fast-growing area of research and development in statistics. While most FDA literature imposes the classical L2 Hilbert structure on function spaces, there is an emergent need for a different, shape-based approach for analyzing functional data. This paper reviews and develops fundamental geometrical concepts that help connect traditionally diverse fields of shape and functional analyses. It showcases that focusing on shapes is often more appropriate when structural features (number of peaks and valleys and their heights) carry salient information in data. It recaps recent mathematical representations and associated procedures for comparing, summarizing, and testing the shapes of functions. Specifically, it discusses three tasks: shape fitting, shape fPCA, and shape regression models. The latter refers to the models that separate the shapes of functions from their phases and use them individually in regression analysis. The ensuing results provide better interpretations and tend to preserve geometric structures. The paper also discusses an extension where the functions are not real-valued but manifold-valued. The article presents several examples of this shape-centric functional data analysis using simulated and real data.},

The overall goal was to determine which consonants had unique tongue positions with respect to other consonants. Nineteen talkers repeated vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) syllables that included consonants /t, d, s, z, ʧ, k, g/ in symmetrical vowel contexts /i, u, a/, embedded in a carrier phrase. Target regions for each consonant, characterized in terms of x,y,z tongue positions at the point of maximum tongue elevation, were extracted. Distances and overlaps were computed between all consonant pairs and compared to the distances and overlaps of their contextual targets. Cognates and postalveolar homorganics were found to share the location of their target regions. On average, alveolar stops showed distinctively different target regions than alveolar fricatives, which in turn showed different target region locations than the postalveolar consonants. Across talker variability in target locations was partially explained by differences in habitual speaking rate and hard palate characteristics.},

What functional constraints and evolutionary mechanisms lie behind linguistic diversity of sound systems is under ongoing debate; in particular, it remains conflicting whether there exists any universal relationship between these constraints despite of diverse sounds systems cross-linguistically. Here, we conducted cross-linguistic typological and phylogenetic analyses to address the characteristics of constraints on linguistic diversity of vowel systems. First, the typological analysis revealed a power-law based dependence between the global structural dispersion and the local focalization of vowel systems and validated that such dependence was independent of geographic region, language family, and linguistic affiliation. Second, the phylogenetic analysis further illustrated that the observed dependence resulted from correlated evolutions of these two structural properties, which proceeded in an adaptive process. These results provide empirical evidence that self-organization mechanisms helped shape vowel systems and common functional constraints took effect on the evolution of vowel systems in the world's languages.},

  abstract = {Dissatisfied with traditional grading, we developed a grading system to directly assess whether students have mastered course material. We identified the set of skills students need to master in a course and provided multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate mastery of each skill. We describe in detail how we implemented the system for two undergraduate courses, Introductory Phonetics and Phonology I. Our goals were to decrease student stress, increase student learning and make students' study efforts more effective, increase students' metacognitive awareness, promote a growth mindset, encourage students to aim for mastery rather than partial credit, be fairer to students facing structural and institutional disadvantages, reduce our time spent on grading, and facilitate complying with new accreditation requirements. Our own reflections and student feedback indicate that many of these goals were met.},
