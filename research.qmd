My research interests span a range of topics within linguistics, although the main focus is on the **study of speech sounds**, and in particular **speech production**, from a variety of intersecting perspectives, including:

-   Acoustics and articulation.
-   Descriptive, historical, and comparative linguistic (typology).
-   Language endangerment.
-   Computational modelling.

The other strand of my research expertise is related to **research methods and statistics**. In particular, I am an enthusiastic advocate of **Open Research** (aka Open Science) and **Bayesian inference**.

For an overview of the research meta-models that inform my research, see the [Meta](meta.qmd) page.

## Language and biological diversity

This project with [Jessica Hampton](https://jesshampton.github.io) focusses on the relationship of linguistic and biological diversity. The project will be developed in three phases:

-   Phase 1: Assessing the link between language endangerment and biodiversity intactness.

-   Phase 2: Developing an index of linguistic diversity intactness.

-   Phase 3: Assessing the link between linguistic and biological diversity intactness.

## *Beyond*

As part of this project with [Jessica Hampton](https://jesshampton.github.io), we set out to write a triptych of papers united by the idea of going "beyond" current practices and dichotomies.

-   Paper 1: Beyond sociolinguistics (on the constructivist/structuralist dichotomy).

-   Paper 2: Beyond the quantitative/qualitative dichotomy.

-   Paper 3: TBD

## Intrinsic vowel duration and gestural distance

Intrinsic vowel duration is the tendency for high vowels to be shorter and low vowels to be longer. In this project I will investigate if articulator origin-to-target distance is sufficient to explain vowel duration or if vowels include category-specific durational targets.

## Hemispheric differences in specificity effects of priming

Project with [Jeremy Steffman](https://jsteffman.github.io) looking at how auditory priming effects are modulated depending on which hemisphere processes the speech signal.

## Vitality of Gallo-Romance of Northern Italy

In this project with [Jessica Hampton](https://jesshampton.github.io) and Simone De Cia, we are conducting a survey study of the vitality of Gallo-Romance in the north of Italy.

## R package development

As part of my ongoing work towards improving quantitative methods in linguistics, I develop and maintain a series of R packages.

## Many Speech Analyses

The *Many Speech Analyses* project (with Timo Roettger and Joseph V. Casillas) set out to quantify the analytic flexibility in the speech sciences and explored how it affects our scientific conclusions. To that end, we asked speech researchers to analyse the same data set in order to answer the same research question.

## The sounds of Albanian

In collaboration with Lejda Kapia, Josianne Riverin-Coutlée, and [Stephen Nichols](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/postgrad/stephen.nichols/home.html), we have investigate the sound system of Albanian.

## Human interaction and the evolution of spoken accent

I worked within the ERC project [*Human interaction and the evolution of spoken accent*](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Forschung/interaccent/interAccent.html) (PI Prof. Jonathan Harrington) at the [Institut für Phonetik und Sprachverarbeitung](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/). This project employs real-time MRI data to investigate, among other things, how articulatory aspects of speech can pave the way for sound change.

## Nasal coarticulation and sound-change: a real-time MRI study

I conducted research within the DFG project [*Nasal coarticulation and sound-change: a real-time MRI study*](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/nasal_coarticulation.html) (PI Prof. Jonathan Harrington).

## Vowel duration and consonant voicing: a production study

As part of my PhD research at the University of Manchester, supervised by Dr <a href="http://www.bermudez-otero.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricardo Bermúdez-Otero</a> and Dr <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/patrycjastrycharczuk/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrycja Strycharczuk</a>), I investigated the effect of consonant voicing on vowel duration, using a combination of acoustic analyses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_tongue_imaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultrasound tongue imaging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroglottograph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electroglottography</a>.

# Glossolects

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(readr)

glossolocs <- read_csv("data/glossolocs.csv")

leaflet(data = glossolocs) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(popup = ~glosso, icon = ~awesomeIcons(
    icon = "circle",
    library = "fa",
    markerColor = colour
  ))
```

<br>

The map shows in blue the main [glossolects](meta.qmd#linguistic-systems) I work(ed) with, and in red glossolects I have studied during my time at University and forgotten to different degrees (approximate locations).

Overall, my interests and expertise cover the following macro-glossolects:

-   Indo-European.
-   Oceanic.
-   South American.

I would very much welcome offers of collaboration on glossolects from other areas of the world, especially from Africa and Asia, which are alas the ones I am the least familiar with.
